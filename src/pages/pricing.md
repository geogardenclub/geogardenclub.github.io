GeoGardenClub is member supported!  Unlike many other gardening apps, GeoGardenClub: 

* Is not a marketing tool for a seed company
* Does not sell or present advertisements
* Does not sell your data 

Our subscription model enables everyone to try out GeoGardenClub free for six months to see if it's a good fit and provides sufficient value for dollar. After that, you'll pay a small monthly or annual fee to enable us to provide this service to you. You save 25% by paying annually! 

Our goal is to improve your gardening productivity so much that you more than make back your investment in GeoGardenClub.
