# GeoGardenClub 2026 Referral Program

### Refer three friends in three months, get three months free!

Grow the GeoGardenClub community (and get more garden plans to snoop) with our 2026 referral program!

### How it works

1. Get (at least) three friends to join GeoGardenClub between February 1 and April 30, 2026.  

2. Email us at referrals@geogardenclub.com by April 30, 2026 with:
   * Your name and username
   * The names and usernames of all the gardeners you referred.

3. After confirming the fine print below, we'll email you a coupon code to receive three free months of GeoGardenClub!

### The fine print

You and your referrals must each create at least one garden with at least one planting. We want new gardeners, not lurkers! 

You and at least three of your referrals must transition out of the free introductory period and into a paid plan before we can send you the coupon code.

All of your referrals must be *new* members of GeoGardenClub (i.e. they've downloaded the app, created an account, and accepted the terms of the subscription) between February 1 and April 30, 2026. (Already existing members don't qualify as referrals.)

Referrals do not need to be in the same chapter as you! Spread the word far and wide!

You can email us as many times as you want with additional names prior to April 30, 2026. There is no limit to the number of new gardeners you can refer--the more the better! That said, additional referrals do not increase the length of the coupon code.

Since new members get three months free, you should expect your coupon code to be sent to you sometime in Summer 2026, after at least three of your referrals (and you) have transitioned to a paid plan. (If you haven't received your coupon code by the end of July 2026, please email us at referrals@geogardenclub.com and we will look into it.)
