# GeoGardenClub Ambassador Program

**Join the movement to grow community food resiliency—one garden at a time!**

GeoGardenClub Ambassadors are passionate gardeners and community connectors who help spread the word about the app through sharing their garden stories to inspire others to grow together.

## Purpose

The GeoGardenClub Ambassador Program is a community leadership initiative designed to:
* Increase awareness and adoption of the GeoGardenClub app
* Foster local networks of gardeners who share data, inspiration, and best practices
* Gather feedback to improve the app for real-world gardeners
* Amplify stories of collaboration and resilience within the gardening community

## Who We’re Looking For

Ambassadors are:
* Active vegetable gardeners who use the GeoGardenClub app
* Excited to share their gardening journey online and in their community
* Comfortable leading small local meetups or tabling at local events
* Eager to provide feedback on new app features and user experience
* Passionate about local food, sustainability, and community building

## Ambassador Activities

Ambassadors choose from a flexible menu of activities, earning cash stipends and perks for each completed action. Activities can be logged monthly through a simple online form and verified with photos, links, or sign-in sheets. Activities can be completed January - September.  Activities outside of this timeframe can be reimbursed with prior approval.
