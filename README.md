# Geo Garden Club Documentation 

This repository contains the sources to construct <https://geogardenclub.github.io>.

This site uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Installation

### Install Node

First, download and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  Verify that your installation was successful by invoking:

```
$ node -v
v14.16.0
```

### Download sources

Second, download the sources for this site from [https://github.com/geogardenclub/geogardenclub.github.io](https://github.com/geogardenclub/geogardenclub.github.io).

Make sure you are in the "source" branch, not the "main" branch.

### Install libraries

Third, change directories into the geogardenclub.github.io repo directory and install third party libraries with:

```
$ npm install

up to date, audited 1162 packages in 13s

205 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

27 vulnerabilities (9 moderate, 18 high)

To address issues that do not require attention, run:
  npm audit fix

To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.
```

The current security problems are unfortunate. Hopefully the Docusaurus folks will clean this up soon.

## Run the site locally

To run the site locally, invoke:

```
 $ npm start

> geogardenclub@1.0.0 start
> docusaurus start

Starting the development server...
Docusaurus website is running at "http://localhost:3000/".

```

The site should shortly appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

To simplify things for now, anyone can edit the sources, but Philip will be in charge of deployment. This means that deployment has the following steps:

### 1. Commit and push your changes to the sources

Commit and push your changes to the source (i.e. the `source` branch).

### 2. Notify Philip

Tell Philip you've made changes to the sources.

### 3. Philip deploys the site

To deploy the site, make sure that GIT_USER is set and that you have commit privileges to the repo, then invoke:

```
npm run deploy
```

This builds the static HTML and commits the results to the `main` branch of the geogardenclub.github.io repository.
