## In this release:

With a new year comes a new major release: 3.0.0!

Added:
* New feature: Insight View!  When you open the app, you will be placed in this view which is designed to provide useful information about your garden and chapter. We're very excited about this feature and will roll out additional Insight Widgets in the next few releases. 

Fixed:
* "Start Date Unknown?" checkbox added to the Planting form. This makes it easy to represent starts that you bought at a store or were given from a friend.
* Fixes to sorting, retail value calculation, and more.


To get the app, see the [Getting Started page](/docs/user-guide/get-started/overview).
