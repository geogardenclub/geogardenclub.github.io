<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="youve-downloaded-geo-garden-clubnow-what">You’ve downloaded Geo Garden Club—now what?<a href="https://geogardenclub.com/blog/2025/02/16/newsletter#youve-downloaded-geo-garden-clubnow-what" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to You’ve downloaded Geo Garden Club—now what?" title="Direct link to You’ve downloaded Geo Garden Club—now what?">​</a></h2>
<p>Begin garden planning in three simple steps:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-create-your-first-garden">1. Create Your First Garden<a href="https://geogardenclub.com/blog/2025/02/16/newsletter#1-create-your-first-garden" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Create Your First Garden" title="Direct link to 1. Create Your First Garden">​</a></h3>
<p>Geo Garden Club helps you stay organized by grouping plantings into beds and beds into gardens. To begin, go to the Home/Gardens screen and create your first garden by tapping the + Garden button and filling out the form in the Create Garden screen.</p>
<p>💡 Tip: You can create multiple gardens! Some gardeners prefer to separate different garden spaces for better planning.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-name-your-first-bed">2. Name Your First Bed<a href="https://geogardenclub.com/blog/2025/02/16/newsletter#2-name-your-first-bed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Name Your First Bed" title="Direct link to 2. Name Your First Bed">​</a></h3>
<p>In the Create Garden screen, you’ll be prompted to name your first “bed.” A bed can be a raised bed, a container, or any designated growing space. You can add more later in the Garden Details Timeline screen.</p>
<p>💡 Tip: Upload a Plot Plan to keep track of your beds!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-add-your-first-planting">3. Add Your First Planting<a href="https://geogardenclub.com/blog/2025/02/16/newsletter#3-add-your-first-planting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Add Your First Planting" title="Direct link to 3. Add Your First Planting">​</a></h3>
<p>Now that you have a garden and a bed, it’s time to add a planting!</p>
<p>From the Home/Gardens screen, tap Details on your new garden to access the Timeline screen.</p>
<p>Tap the + button to add a planting.</p>
<p>Fill out the Create Planting form with details like the crop, variety (or select "unknown"), and anticipated planting and harvest dates.</p>
<p>💡 Tip: Set an anticipated harvest date to automatically create a task. When you mark the task as complete, your garden plan will update with the actual harvest date!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="salish-seed-guild-seed-swap">Salish Seed Guild Seed Swap<a href="https://geogardenclub.com/blog/2025/02/16/newsletter#salish-seed-guild-seed-swap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Salish Seed Guild Seed Swap" title="Direct link to Salish Seed Guild Seed Swap">​</a></h2>
