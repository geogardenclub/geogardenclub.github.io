## APP STORE LAUNCH!

We are thrilled to announce that Geo Garden Club is officially available in the App Store!



To celebrate, we are giving away six months free of Geo Garden Club to everyone that subscribes in our first year! After the free period, Geo Garden Club is $4.99/month.  Why? Geo Garden Club is user supported so we don't sell your data or show ads.

Android user? We are working on our Google Play release next, in the meantime contact us to join our Android beta test.

Thank you so much for your support in Geo Garden Club's early years. We are so excited to grow with you!
