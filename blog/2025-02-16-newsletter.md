## You’ve downloaded Geo Garden Club—now what? 

Begin garden planning in three simple steps:

### 1. Create Your First Garden

Geo Garden Club helps you stay organized by grouping plantings into beds and beds into gardens. To begin, go to the Home/Gardens screen and create your first garden by tapping the + Garden button and filling out the form in the Create Garden screen.

💡 Tip: You can create multiple gardens! Some gardeners prefer to separate different garden spaces for better planning.

### 2. Name Your First Bed
   
In the Create Garden screen, you’ll be prompted to name your first “bed.” A bed can be a raised bed, a container, or any designated growing space. You can add more later in the Garden Details Timeline screen.

💡 Tip: Upload a Plot Plan to keep track of your beds!

### 3. Add Your First Planting

Now that you have a garden and a bed, it’s time to add a planting!

From the Home/Gardens screen, tap Details on your new garden to access the Timeline screen.

Tap the + button to add a planting.

Fill out the Create Planting form with details like the crop, variety (or select "unknown"), and anticipated planting and harvest dates.

💡 Tip: Set an anticipated harvest date to automatically create a task. When you mark the task as complete, your garden plan will update with the actual harvest date!
