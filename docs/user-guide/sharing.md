# Sharing

:::tip How (and why) to use GGC Sharing
:::

One of the goals of GeoGardenClub is to support garden-related resource sharing among Chapter members: seeds, plants, harvests, tools, materials, and more. To help support sharing, we provide the "Share" view within the Home screen.

Sharing is simple: a gardener can create a "Post" describing something that they'd like to offer or are seeking. Other gardeners can create a "Reply" if they can help out. 

:::info GGC Sharing is free
The GGC Sharing service is intended for no-cost offering of goods and services to others. Of course, exchange of food items is encouraged! 

If you want to sell something, please use other services such as Craigslist or Facebook marketplace.

## Let's share lettuce

To understand how GGC Sharing works, let's look at a simple example.

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/share-view.png"/>

In this example, a Gardener with username "@fluke" creates a Post indicating that they have some extra lettuce that they would be willing to share with other chapter members.

Next, "@katiekai" replies, which leads to a conversation between @katiekai and @fluke:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/share-reply.png"/>

It's important to note that sharing a resource usually requires at least one of the people to provide contact information. In this example, after @katiekai has responded to say that she'd "love some of that lettuce", @fluke makes a *private* reply with their phone number (555-555-5555). You can see that the reply is private because there is a red "lock" icon next to the reply.  Private replies can only be viewed by the author of the reply and the author of the post (or reply) being replied to. So, @fluke does not have to reveal their phone number to the entire Chapter, just to @katiekai.

Once @fluke has replied with her phone number, the two of them presumably have a conversation, and @katiekai confirms the result of this convo with a private reply that they will meet on Wednesday at Trackside.  

Since @fluke is the signed in Gardener (as indicated by the top navbar), this conversation is visible. If the signed in Gardener was not @fluke or @katiekai, the replies with the lock icon would not be visible. 

## Create Share Post

To create a Share Post, go the Home screen, click on the "Share" icon in the bottom nav bar, and click "+ Share Post" (as shown in the above screen shots). After clicking "+ Share Post", the user is taken to the Create Share Post screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/share-post-create.png"/>

Fill out the form as follows:

**Share Post Type:** One of "Offering" or "Seeking".

**Share Post Item Type:** One of "Seed", "Plant", "Harvest", "Tool", "Material", or "Other".

**Title:** A short description of what is to be shared.

**Description:** Details, if necessary.

**Picture:** An optional picture of the thing being offered or sought.

**Share Post Completed:** If the share request has successfully concluded, you can mark it as complete to hide it from view by default.  (An alternative is to delete it. Eventually completed posts will be deleted by administrators. Choose completion over deletion if you want to retain the ability to see the conversation for a little while.)

## Update Share Post

If you want to change the details of your Share Post, click on the "three dot" menu associated with it to bring up a menu containing "Edit Share Post", "Set Share Post to Completed", and "Delete Share Post":

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/share-post-menu.png"/>

Tap the "Edit Share Post" to go to the Update Share Post screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/share-post-update.png"/>

Edit any details and tap "Submit" to make the changes. 

## Mark Share Post as Completed

To set the Share Post to completed, click on the "three dot" menu and select "Mark Share Post to Completed".  This will immediately set the Share Post to completed and hide it from view. 

If you want to see it, tap the Visibility (eye) icon in the top navbar, which toggles the display of completed Share Posts.

## Delete Share Post

To delete a Share Post, click on the "three dot" menu and select "Delete Share Post". This brings up the Delete Share Post screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/share-post-delete.png"/>

Tap "Delete" to delete the Post and all of its replies.

## Create Share Reply

To create a Reply to a Post (or to another Reply), click the "Reply" button associated with the Post or Reply you want to reply to. This brings up the Create Share Reply screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/share-reply-create.png"/>

Provide your reply and an optional picture, and indicate if you want this to be a private reply. Tap "Submit" to create it.

## Update Share Reply 

To update your reply, click the "three dot" menu associated with the Reply and select "Edit Share Reply" to take you to the Update Share Reply screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/share-reply-update.png"/>

Edit as you like and tap "Submit" to make the change.

## Delete Share Reply

Note that Share Replies cannot be deleted once created. If you need to, you can edit an existing Share Reply and delete the reply text.
