Fill out the form in the **Create Garden Screen**  
 - Name: Give your garden a name.  This name is public to others.
 - Picture (optional) add a picture to be associated with your garden.  This could be a garden map or photo.
 - Editors (optional): If there are other people who help complete tasks in your garden you'll want to make them an editor.  Add their email and they'll get an invite.
 - Bed Names: Add the names of your garden beds.  Some gardeners use numbers (01, 02) combine numbers with cardinal directions (N1, S1), and for others prefer to use more descriptive names based off of bed shapes or nearby infrastructure (Circle, Compost).  You don't need to include the word "bed", we've done that for you!  You can come back and add more beds at any time.
 - Community or school garden?  Check this box if this is a community or school garden.  There are special badges for gardeners that participate in these group efforts!
 - Pesticide free garden?  Check this box if you are committed to not using pesticides in your garden.  There are special badges for gardeners who choose to be pesticide free.

Hit **Submit** and you are ready to start adding plantings.
