Geo Garden Club believes that seed saving and sharing is a critical component of building resilient gardening communities.  By saving seeds, gardeners can ensure that they have access to the varieties that grow best in their area.  By sharing seeds, gardeners can help others in their community grow the same varieties.

In Timeline and Filter Screens, this period of time is noted in blue.

## Planning for seed saving

<img style={{float: "left", padding: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/user-guide/update-planting.png"/>

If you are planning on collecting seeds from one of your crops, that could likely mean that the planting will need to remain in the garden for an extended period of time.  You can denote a "Last Harvest Date" in the planting's details screen to indicate the period of time between harvesting and when the plant is ultimately pulled from the bed and therefore no longer requiring bed space.

## Offering seeds to other chapter gardeners

If you have seeds that you would like to offer to other chapter gardeners, you can add them to the chapter's **Resource Index.**  Navigate to the Sharing Index Screen and tap **+ Resource.**  Select the type of resource you are sharing, and then add the details of the resource.  You can then navigate to the chapter's chat room to let others know that you have seeds available.
