# Chapters

:::tip How (and why) to look at Chapters
:::

The Chapters Index screen, which can be accessed from the Drawer, provides access to overviews of your Chapter and all of the other Chapters in GGC.

## View your Chapter

By default, this screen shows the "My Chapter" tab, which provides a summary of information about the chapter: the crops used, the gardens defined, the number of gardeners, and so forth.

Note that each section can be expanded to show more details:

If a Chip is displayed, you can tap it to go to details about it.


## View other Chapters

Clicking the "Other Chapters" tab enables you to see information about other GGC Chapters:

## Lurk mode

When viewing other Chapters, a feature called "Lurk Mode" is available. By clicking the "Lurk Mode" button associated with another Chapter, you can "transport" yourself into the other Chapter and view its Gardens and certain other kinds of information:

Lurk Mode is read-only: you can't actually do anything in the other Chapter, you can just look:

When in Lurk Mode, a red banner indicates where you are and provides an exit button that you can use to return to your home Chapter.
