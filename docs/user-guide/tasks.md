# Tasks

:::tip How (and why) to define Tasks
:::

In GeoGardenClub, Tasks support two important goals:

*Tasks provide a "To Do" list to help remind you of activities (planting, transplanting, etc).*  If you co-manage a Garden with others (i.e. you have defined Editors for your Garden), then Tasks can help organize who does what and indicate what hasn't been accomplished.

*Tasks help you to create accurate records of planting dates.* Whenever you complete a Task associated with a Planting date, you have the opportunity to update that date. This makes it appropriate for you to "guesstimate" dates (such as First Harvest date) early in the year when you are planning your garden, and then replace that guesstimate with the actual First Harvest date when it actually happens.  

## Viewing Tasks

There are two ways to view your Tasks. 

First, the Tasks view in the Home Screen shows all of your Tasks across all of your Gardens. In this view, "your Gardens" includes both the Gardens you own and the Gardens for which you are an Editor:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/tasks-view-home-screen.png"/>

In this example, the displayed Tasks are associated with two Gardens: Alderwood and Flukes Tail Garden.

The second way to view Tasks is through the Tasks view of the Garden Details screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/tasks-view-garden-details.png"/>

In this case, the displayed Tasks are only those associated with the Garden you selected for Garden Details.

## Creating Tasks

Tasks are always associated with a Planting. Task can be created automatically or manually.

*Automatically created Tasks:* Whenever you define a Planting date (such as Start, Transplant, First Harvest, Last Harvest, or Pull date), a Task with the associated date is automatically created for you.

*Manually created Tasks:* If you want to create additional Tasks for a Planting, you can do that manually. To do that, go to the Planting Details screen for the Planting and click the "+" button at the bottom left of the screen:


<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/tasks-manual-creation-1.png"/>

Tap "+ Task" to bring up the Create Planting Task screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/tasks-manual-creation-2.png"/>

Create the Task, and it will be associated with that Garden and Planting.

:::info Can I create manual Tasks that are associated with Beds or Gardens? 
Unfortunately, not yet.  Currently, all Tasks have to be associated with a Planting. As a workaround, you can create a Task manually that is associated with a single Planting, and then note in the Description field that the Task should actually be performed across the entire Bed (or Garden). Not elegant, but it's better than nothing.

## Update a Task
 
You can update a Task in two ways: by editing the Task directly, or by editing the dates associated with a Planting. 

### ... directly

To edit a Task directly, tap the "three dot" icon on a Task card to reveal a menu containing "Update Task" and "Delete Task":

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/update-task-1.png"/>

Tap "Update Task" to go to the Update Task screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/update-task-2.png"/>

Now you can edit the Title, Description, or Due Date.

### ... indirectly

Another way to update a Task is by updating its associated Planting date. 

For example, if you edit a Planting and update its Transplant Date, the Task associated with that date will be automatically updated. In this case, you cannot edit the Title or Description; only the date will be changed.

## Delete a Task

To delete a Task, tap the "three dot" icon at the top right of the Task Card:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/update-task-1.png"/>

Now tap the "Delete Task" menu item to bring up the Delete Task screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/delete-task.png"/>

Tap "Delete" to delete the Task.
