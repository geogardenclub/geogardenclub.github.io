# Tasks

## What are tasks?
Tasks turn your plans into action.  Tasks help you stay on top of gardening activities while also keeping your gardening timelines up to date.  Tasks can be autogenerated from planting timelines or you can create a custom task.

## Where do I find Tasks?
Locate Tasks by navigating to the Home section of the app and from the side navigation menu.

## How are Tasks created?
Tasks are created from garden's planting timelines or you can create custom tasks.  

### Autogenerated Tasks 
When you add a planting to your garden, tasks are automatically generated from required data about the planting:
 - Start date
 - Pull date
More tasks can be automatically generated by adding optional information about the planting:
 - Transplant date
 - First harvest date

### Custom Tasks
To create a new task for a garden, navigate into that garden's "Details" section
