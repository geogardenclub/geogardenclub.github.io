# Gardens

:::tip How (and why!) to define gardens.
:::

You can define any number of gardens as a member of GeoGardenClub. Many members will define just one garden.  But you could also define more than one, say a "front yard garden" and a "back yard garden", or maybe a "herb garden" and a "produce garden".

Defining a garden enables you to:
* Record what Plantings you grew in each Bed during each season.
* Record the timing of each Planting (such as the start date, transplant date, first harvest date, and pull date). 
* Record the outcomes associated with each Planting (such as its appearance, yield, quantity, resilience, and germination success).
* Record observations, possibly including a picture, to help you remember important events as they occur.

You don't have to do all of these things, of course!  But by tracking at least some of this information over time, you can gather data that enables you to improve your garden's productivity each season.  Plus, as a member of GeoGardenClub, you can see the data collected by other members to accelerate your learning even more.

For example, you can find out which variety of Beans grows best in your area, or find out when others are transplanting tomatoes, or learn about a pest that has appeared in someone's garden in your Chapter and take preventative measures.

## Create a garden

Click on the "+ Garden" button in the lower left corner. This will bring up the **Create Garden Screen**:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/create-garden.png"/>

Fill out the form as follows:

**Name**: Give your garden a name.  This name is public to others, and must be unique.

**Picture**: (optional) Add a picture to be associated with your garden.  This could be a garden map or photo.

**Plot Plan**: (optional)  Add a picture of your garden plot plan.  This is especially helpful to help you remember which bed is which.

**Editors**: (optional)  Specify people who help complete tasks in your garden as a comma-separated list of usernames.  By adding their username, they will be able to create, update, and delete beds, plantings, tasks, outcomes, and so forth. You can add or subtract editors at any time in the **Update Garden Screen.**

**Initial Bed Name**: Add the name of one garden bed.  Beds can represent literal garden beds, pots/containers, a greenhouse, or other locations where you grow food.  Additional beds can be added in the **Timeline Screen** (more instructions below)  

Bed names must be:
* 20 characters long or less
* Made of letters, numbers, and spaces.  No special characters.
* You don't need to include the word "bed", we'll do that for you!
