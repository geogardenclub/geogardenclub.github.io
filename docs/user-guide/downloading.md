# Downloading

This page details the downloading process for beta testers.  Once we move past beta testing, the app will be available for download in the app store.  At this time you must download the app through Firebase.  We hope to soon have TestFlight as an option for iPhone users.

## Downloading through TestFlight

Coming soon for iPhone users!

## Downloading through Firebase

1. Using your mobile device, look for an email invitation to get started as an app tester.  The subject line will read: "You've been invited to test GeoGardenClub for iOS"  It might be in your spam folder.
**Note:** If you have a hotmail or yahoo email address, this email may not be delivered or may be delayed by 24 hours.

2. Tap **Get Started**
