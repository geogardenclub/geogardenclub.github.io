# Downloading

This page details the downloading process for beta testers.  Once we move past beta testing, the app will be available for download in app stores.  If you have an iPhone or iPad, you will download the app through TestFlight.  If you have an Android device, you will download the app through Firebase.

## Downloading through TestFlight (iPhone and iPad only)

1.  Using your mobile device, open your inbox for your email account associated with your Apple ID.  Look for an email from App Store Connect inviting you to access App Store Connect (check Spam folder if you don't see it).  **Accept** the invitation.

2. After this invitation has been accepted, look for an email invitation from TestFlight inviting you to test GeoGardenClub (check Spam folder if you don't see it).  The subject line will read: "Philip Johnson has invited to test GeoGardenClub."  Tap **View in TestFlight.**
