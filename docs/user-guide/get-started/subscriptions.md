:::tip Step 4: Select your subscription
:::

Before you can start to use the services provided by GeoGardenClub, you must become a subscriber.  The first time you sign in to GeoGardenClub, after completing your profile, you will be taken to a screen similar to the following in order to accept the terms of either our annual or monthly subscription plan:

:::info Why join GGC?
GeoGardenClub is supported entirely by its members, and we rely entirely on subscription revenue to support the services we offer. We are an independent company, we are not funded by seed companies or other companies in the gardening industry, we do not show advertisements in the app, and we will never sell your data. 

Our goal is to improve your gardening productivity so much that you actually save money by using GGC.

All GGC subscription plans come with a free introductory period so that you can experience membership and decide if GGC is for you. If it isn't, then you can cancel your subscription any time before the end of the introductory period and not be charged.

Once you have accepted the subscription, after clicking through a short sequence of onboarding screens, you will arrive at your Home screen where you can define your first garden!

## Managing your subscription plan

You can always change from one subscription plan to another. In iOS, for example, you can go to Settings, click on your user account name,  select Subscriptions, and then select GeoGardenClub to see your current subscription plan and status:

Note that if you switch to a different plan during your free trial period, you will lose the remainder of your free trial and will be billed immediately.
