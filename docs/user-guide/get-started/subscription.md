:::info Why join GGC?
GeoGardenClub is supported entirely by its members, and we rely entirely on subscription revenue to support the services we offer. We are an independent company, we are not funded by seed companies or other companies in the gardening industry, we do not show advertisements in the app, and we will never sell your data. 

Our mission is to improve your gardening productivity so much that you actually save money by using GGC.

All GGC subscriptions come with a free introductory period so that you can experience membership and decide if GGC is for you. If it isn't, then you can cancel your subscription any time before the end of the introductory period and not be charged.

Once you have accepted the subscription, after clicking through a short sequence of onboarding screens, you will arrive at your Home screen where you can define your first garden!
