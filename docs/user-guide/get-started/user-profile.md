:::tip Step 3: Initialize your user profile.

The User Profile screen allows you to provide important information regarding your membership in GeoGardenClub. It is where you indicate your geographic region, which enables us to group you with your neighbors and thus provide you with relevant gardening information and insights. 

## Create User Profile

When you first sign in to GeoGardenClub, you will be taken to the Create User Profile screen:

**UserID:** This is a read-only field that displays the email address you used when you registered in the previous screen.

**Country:** A pull-down menu showing the countries that have GGC Chapters. Select your country.

**State:** A pull-down menu showing the States (or Provinces) with Chapters in the selected country. Select your state.

**Region:** A pull-down menu showing regions (typically counties) within the selected country and state. Select your region.

**Postal Code:** A pull-down menu showing the postal codes defined for the selected country, state, and region. Select your postal code.

**Username:** A text field allowing you to define a username. GeoGardenClub does not reveal your name or email address to other users. Instead, you are identified by your username. All usernames must start with a "@". For example, @gardenerbob.  Note that usernames must be unique, so if the username is taken, you will be asked to choose another one after you click "Submit".

Tap the **Submit** button to create your user profile.

## Update User Profile

After your profile has been created, you can make changes to certain parts of it by selecting the Drawer, selecting Settings, and then selecting Update User Profile. This takes you to the Update User Profile screen:
