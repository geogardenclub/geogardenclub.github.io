# Retail Value

:::tip Show me the money
:::

Retail Value provides an estimate of the cost to purchase the same quantity of produce you grew in your garden from a store. This is useful for the following reasons:

* One goal of GeoGardenClub is to improve community food resilience. Retail Value provides a measure that can help assess the impact of each GGC Chapter on its community's food resilience. 
* Another goal of GeoGardenClub is to help gardeners improve their garden's productivity, ideally to the point where the value of the produce grown in a season exceeds the cost of materials for the garden for that same season.

To utilize the Retail Value feature, all you have to do is provide a value for the "Quantity" field for a Planting.  You do this in the [Update Planting](plantings.md#update-a-planting) screen. For example, the following screen illustrates an update to a Planting of Mango to indicate that 250 lbs of mango were harvested:

Once that value is entered and the Submit button is pressed, the Planting summary updates to indicate the quantity and retail value of that Planting:

At the same time, that Garden's summary view is updated to indicate the new retail value of that Planting as well as all other Plantings in the garden for which quantity values have been provided:

Finally, the Chapter summary view is updated to indicate the new retail value of that Planting as well as all other Plantings in all other Gardens in the Chapter for which quantity values have been provided:

The Retail Value feature is experimental because there is a lot going on behind the scenes. We think calculating retail value will be too time-consuming for Gardeners if they have to come up with the cost of each crop or variety themselves.

Instead, the Chapter admin has the responsibility of doing the research and determining, for each year, a reasonable retail value for the crops and/or varieties being grown by Gardeners in their geographic region (i.e. Chapter).

There is a lot of subjectivity in determining a "reasonable retail value", and so we view the Retail Value feature as experimental at this time. 

However, if it's possible to determine a "reasonable retail value", then it's possible for the app to provide Gardeners with an estimate of the retail value of their harvest for each year, simply by asking them to provide the "quantity" of harvest from each Planting, as you'll see next.

Once a Gardener has entered at least one "Quantity" for a Planting, then the Garden view will include a "Retail Value" section that shows the Retail Value for all Plantings with Quantity values for which a Chapter admin has provided Retail Value data. For example:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/retail-value-3.png"/>

The bottom of this section provides totals for each year:

If a Gardener keeps a rough track of their expenses, then they can determine if the Garden was cost-effective. In this example, the app estimates that it would have cost this Gardener $647.50 to buy the equivalent amount of food that they harvested from their Garden. If that Gardener spent less than that amount on materials for the Garden, then the Garden was cost-effective.

The Retail Value feature is still under development. Drop us a line at info@geogardenclub.com if you have any thoughts about it!
