# Garden Planning Tips

## Find inspiration in the Crops Index
Look through the Crop Index for inspiration about what to grow.  Use it to jog your memory about a crop you might be forgetting to include or to learn about a new crop you've never grown before.

Navigate to the Crops Index by tapping the menu icon <img width="20" src="/img/user-guide/menu-icon.jpg"/> at the top left of your screen.  Select **Crops.**

For each crop, expand each section to see more details. 
 - View which gardens have grown the crop, and tap those garden chips to be taken to the garden's **Garden Summary Screen,** and from there the **Garden Details** for timeline information.
 - See which gardeners have experience growing the crop
 - Check out the outcomes for a sense of how easy that crop is to grow locally
 - Notice which varieties are being grown
 - Look through the observations to see pictures of that crop and notes from local gardeners.

## Save time with Copy Planting

A great garden planning feature is the ability to copy a planting from one year to the next or one bed to another.  Navigate to the planting and tap the copy icon at the top menu.  Update bed if needed.  Update the dates the the next year or make other adjustments as needed.  Then, select **Submit.**
