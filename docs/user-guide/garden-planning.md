# Garden Planning Tips

## Your first garden plan

Look through the Crop Index for inspiration about what to grow.  Note the number of gardens and gardeners growing the crop.  

Review the outcomes for a sense of how difficult the crop is to grow locally.

Check out the varieties that other gardeners have been growing

Look at the observations to see pictures of the plant growing and to learn what other gardeners have been observing about the plant.

## Your second, third, and all future garden plans

A great garden planning feature is the ability to copy a planting from one year to the next.  Navigate to the planting and tap the copy icon at the top menu.  Update bed if needed.  Update the dates the the next year or make other adjustments as needed.  Then, select **Submit.**
