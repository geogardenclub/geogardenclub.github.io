# Guided Tour

Geo Garden Club was created to answer questions a gardener might have as they plan or work through the gardening season to increase the performance of the garden and efficiency of the gardener.  The following are some of the questions that Geo Garden Club can help answer and how to find the answers.

## Which varieties of corn grow best in my area?

## When I grew beets two years ago, how did that work out?

## I had a great crop of beets last year, how can I replicate that success?

## Does anyone have basil seeds to share?

## Who in my chapter is really good at growing tomatoes?

## Who might I contact for advice on growing a pesticide-free garden?

## What cover crops are being used in my chapter?

## Are there gardens using native plants in my chapter?

## How many days do I need to keep this plant in the garden before pulling it to replace with another plant if I want to harvest seeds?
