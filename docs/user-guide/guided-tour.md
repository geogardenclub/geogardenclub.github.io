# Frequently Asked (Gardening) Questions

Geo Garden Club was created to increase the performance of home, community, and school gardens and efficiency of the gardener by answering questions a gardener might have as they plan or work through the gardening season.  Here are some of the questions that Geo Garden Club can help answer:

## I'm new to the area, what should I plant here?

Look through the Crop Index for inspiration about what to grow.  Use it to jog your memory about a crop you might be forgetting to include or to learn about a new crop you've never grown before.

Navigate to the Crops Index by tapping the menu icon <img width="20" src="/img/user-guide/menu-icon.jpg"/> at the top left of your screen.  Select **Crops.**

For each crop, expand each section to see more details.
- View which gardens have grown the crop, and tap those garden chips to be taken to the garden's **Garden Summary Screen,** and from there the **Garden Details** for timeline information.
- See which gardeners have experience growing the crop
- Check out the outcomes for a sense of how easy that crop is to grow locally
- Notice which varieties are being grown.
- Look through the observations to see pictures of that crop and notes from local gardeners.

After you've chosen a crop to grow, you can see which varieties have been most successfully grown by chapter gardeners.  Expand the Varieties section for that crop, or use the Outcomes Variety filter to see which varieties have been grown and how well they've performed.  Gold variety chips indicate that the variety has been frequently grown by chapter members with great outcomes.

## I like to rotate my crops.  What did I grow in a specific garden bed over the last three years?

You can see the history of what was grown in a garden bed by first navigating to that garden's **Garden Details Screen.**  Then, select **Filter** from the bottom navigation menu and at select **Filter by Bed.**  Select the bed you are interested in to see the crops that have been grown in that bed for all seasons of data you have entered into the app.

## What if I know the crop but not the variety for seeds I'm planting?

Sometimes you may not know the variety name of the seeds you are planting (perhaps they were shared with you and just labelled with crop name or maybe you haven't decided which variety but know you want that crop included in your plans).  You can add that crop and leave variety blank. This will allow you to enter the crop into your timeline without specifying the variety.  You can always update the variety later if you find out the name.

This means if you see a planting in a Garden Details Screen that doesn't include a variety, the variety is unknown.  

## What does it mean when a Seed Start Date says N/A?

This means that the seed is from a vendor, as opposed to being grown in the chapter,and so the date the parent plant was sown is unknown.
