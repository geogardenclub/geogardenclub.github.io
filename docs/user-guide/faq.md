# Frequently Asked Questions

:::tip How to use GeoGardenClub to improve your gardening.
:::

Here are some frequently asked (gardening) questions and how you might use GeoGardenClub to answer them.

## I just moved here, what should I plant?

A good place to start is the Crop Index Screen. Use this screen to find crops that have been planted in several gardens in your Chapter. For example, the following screen shows that Arugula has been planted in 8 gardens in this Chapter:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-arugula.png"/>

When you find a popular crop such as Arugula, you might next open the Outcomes panel to see how successfully it's been grown. In the case of Arugula, it looks pretty good!

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-arugula-2.png"/>

You can also open the Varieties tab to see what kinds of Arugula gardeners have tried to grow.  If a Variety chip has a gold background, that means it's been grown several times with good outcomes.  In this Chapter, it turns out that the Astro Variety of Arugula has earned Gold status:

To learn more about Astro Arugula, just tap the chip to take you to the Astro Arugula Details Screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-arugula-4.png"/>

Now you know the Gardens where Astro Arugula has been grown and the Gardeners who grew it. Tap a Garden or Gardener chip if you like to continue your exploration. From this screen you can also see the Observations that Gardeners have made about Astro Arugula.

## How do I record data about perennials?

First, recall that each Planting has five associated dates: Start Date, Transplant Date, First Harvest Date, Last Harvest Date, and Pull Date. Each Planting also has five Outcomes and a Quantity field:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-planting-fields.png"/>

With perennials, for each year, you usually want to record data about the first and last harvest dates, one or more Outcomes, and perhaps the quantity of your harvest. 

To accomplish this, you can create a Planting with the Start Date of January 1 and a Pull Date of December 31, then provide as much data as you wish regarding that perennial for that single year. For example, here is some data for a Mango tree in the Oahu-HI Chapter for 2024:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-perennial.png"/>

You can also create Observations for that Planting to provide further data about your perennial for that single year.  

To easily create a new Planting for this perennial for another year, just tap the "Copy Planting" icon in the Navbar.  This will create a new Planting with fields initialized from the current Planting.

## Who is good at growing tomatoes?

One way to identify gardeners who are good at growing specific crops is to go to the Badge Index screen, select Gardener from the bottom navigation menu, and scroll to the "Crop Whisperer" card:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-crop-whisperer.png"/>

The "Crop Whisperer" badge is awarded to Gardeners who have grown a crop several times with good outcomes.  This badge is awarded with 1, 2, or 3 stars to indicate levels of experience.  In this case, @jenna has a lot of experience with Tomatos (and a few other crops as well!):

## When should I plant tomatoes?

First, find a garden where tomatoes have been planted previously (which could be your own garden or a garden associated with a Tomato "Crop Whisperer", as discussed above.)

Next, navigate to that Garden's Details Screen, select Filter from the bottom navigation menu, and select Crops and "Tomato". You'll see a screen displaying timing data, for example:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-filter.png"/>

From this, you can see that this gardener planted their tomator

Tap the planting bar to see timing specifics and outcomes, as well as any observations.

## When I grew (say) beets two years ago, how did that work out?

You can see the outcomes related to a specific planting by navigating to the Garden Details Screen and then selecting Timeline from the bottom navigation menu.  From there, scroll to the year you are looking for information for, and tap the relevant planting bar.  It will display the timing and outcomes data for that specific planting.

Or, you can see the outcomes related to a specific planting by navigating to the Garden Details Screen and then selecting Filter from the bottom navigation menu.  Select Filter By Crop and select Beets to see all of your beet plantings listed by year.  Tap the appropriate planting bar to see timing specifics and outcomes, as well as any observations.

## I had a great crop of (say) beets last year, how can I replicate that success?

You can see find information about successful plantings by navigating to the Garden Details Screen and then selecting Timeline from the bottom navigation menu.  From there, scroll to the year you are looking for information for, and tap the planting bar for beets.  It will display the timing and outcomes data for that specific planting.

Or, you can see the outcomes related to a specific planting by navigating to the Garden Details Screen and then selecting Filter from the bottom navigation menu.  Select Filter By Crop and select Beets to see all of your beet plantings listed by year.  Tap the appropriate planting bar to view timing specifics and outcomes, as well as any observations.  

Copy that planting to this year's timeline by selecting copy icon from the top menu.  Update fields as necessary.  For any dates, update the year to the current year. Once complete, select Submit.



## How can I replicate the success of another gardener in my chapter?

You can replicate the practices of another gardener by finding them in the Gardener Index Screen Then, select the garden you are interested in learning specifics about.  From there, you can select Details to see information about their timing and outcomes for each crop they have grown.

A great garden planning feature is the ability to copy a planting from one year to the next, one bed to another, or from another garden to your own.  Navigate to the planting and tap the copy icon at the top menu.  Update bed if needed.  The dates will automatically update to the current year and can be adjusted as needed.  Then, select Submit.

## I like to rotate my crops.  What did I grow in a specific garden bed over the last three years?

You can see the history of what was grown in a garden bed by first navigating to that garden's Garden Details Screen.  Then, select Filter from the bottom navigation menu and at select Filter by Bed.  Select the bed you are interested in to see the crops that have been grown in that bed for all seasons of data you have entered into the app.

## What if I know the crop but not the variety for seeds I'm planting?

Sometimes you may not know the variety name of the seeds you are planting (perhaps they were shared with you and just labelled with crop name or maybe you haven't decided which variety but know you want that crop included in your plans).  You can add that crop and leave variety blank. 

## How do I deal with Plantings that are grown in a climate controlled environment for their entire lifecycle?

One option is to designate a garden bed for these plantings.  For example, you might define a bed called "GH" (for Greenhouse).

Another option is to create a separate Garden for these plantings.  

## How do I add transplants to my garden that I didn't grow?

Sometimes you may buy or get gifted seedlings that you didn't start from seed yourself.  In this case, you can add a planting for the transplant with the Start Date equal to the Transplant Date.  

## How do I define a Planting when I don't know the bed?

If you want to add a Planting to your garden plan, but aren't yet sure of the bed, you can create a bed called (say) "TEMP" to hold these plantings.  These plantings can later be reassigned to a different bed.
