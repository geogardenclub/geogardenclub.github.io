## I just moved here, what grows well?

A good place to start is the Crop Index Screen. Use this screen to find crops that have been planted in several gardens in your Chapter. For example, the following screen shows that Arugula has been planted in 8 gardens in this Chapter:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-arugula.png"/>

When you find a popular crop such as Arugula, you might next open the Outcomes panel to see how successfully it's been grown. In the case of Arugula, it looks pretty good!

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-arugula-2.png"/>

You can also open the Varieties tab to see what kinds of Arugula gardeners have tried to grow.  If a Variety chip has a gold background, that means it's been grown several times with good outcomes.  In this Chapter, it turns out that the Astro Variety of Arugula has earned Gold status:

To learn more about Astro Arugula, just tap the chip to take you to the Astro Arugula Details Screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-arugula-4.png"/>

Now you know the Gardens where Astro Arugula has been grown and the Gardeners who grew it. Tap a Garden or Gardener chip if you like to continue your exploration. From this screen you can also see the Observations that Gardeners have made about Astro Arugula.

## How do I handle perennials?

First, recall that each Planting has five associated dates: Start Date, Transplant Date, First Harvest Date, Last Harvest Date, and Pull Date. Each Planting also has five Outcomes and a Quantity field:

With perennials, for each year, you usually want to record data about the first and last harvest dates, one or more Outcomes, and perhaps the quantity of your harvest. 

To accomplish this, you can create a Planting with the Start Date of January 1 and a Pull Date of December 31, then provide as much data as you wish regarding that perennial for that single year. For example, here is some data for a Mango tree in the Oahu-HI Chapter for 2024:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-perennial.png"/>

You can also create Observations for that Planting to provide further data about your perennial for that single year.  

To easily create a new Planting for the next year, just tap the "Copy Planting" icon in the Navbar.  This will create a new Planting with fields initialized from the current Planting.

## Who is good at growing tomatoes?

One way to identify gardeners who are good at growing specific crops is to go to the Badge Index screen, select Gardener from the bottom navigation menu, and scroll to the "Crop Whisperer" card:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-crop-whisperer.png"/>

The "Crop Whisperer" badge is awarded to Gardeners who have grown a crop several times with good outcomes.  This badge is awarded with 1, 2, or 3 stars to indicate levels of experience.  In this case, @jenna has a lot of experience with Tomatoes (and a few other crops as well!):

As a next step, you might visit their garden to get more details about how they grew their tomatoes. You could also go to the Chat view of your Home screen, select their Garden, and ask a question about how they grew their tomatoes. 

## When should I plant tomatoes?

First, find a garden where tomatoes have been planted previously (which could be your own garden or a garden associated with a Tomato "Crop Whisperer", as discussed above.)

Next, navigate to that Garden's Details Screen, select Filter from the bottom navigation menu, and select Crops and "Tomato". You'll see a screen displaying timing data for that single crop for all the years that it was planted in that Garden. For example:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-filter.png"/>

From this, you can see that this gardener planted their tomatoes indoors in mid-March, and transplanted them outdoors in mid-May.  For more exact timing data, just tap on a Planting Bar. For example:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-filter-2.png"/>


## How do I implement crop rotation?

Crop rotation is the practice of planting different types of crops each season, which helps maintain soil health, manage pests, and optimize nutrient levels. 

One heuristic for rotation is to plant a Crop from a different Family than was previously planted. Fortunately, this is easy to figure out in GeoGardenClub. First, go the Garden Details Screen, select Filter from the bottom navigation menu, then select  Filter by Bed.  Select the bed of interest for Crop rotation. For example, Bed 02:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-rotation.png"/>

You can see that the last Crop grown in this Bed was Summer Squash. Tap on the Planting Bar to see details about that Planting, including this crop's Family:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/faq/faq-rotation-2.png"/>

In the case of Summer Squash, the Family is "Curcurbit", and so you would want to select a Crop from a different Family to grow in Bed 02 next season.
