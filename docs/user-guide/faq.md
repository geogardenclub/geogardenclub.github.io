Sometimes you may not know the variety name of the seeds you are planting (perhaps they were shared with you and just labelled with crop name or maybe you haven't decided which variety but know you want that crop included in your plans).  You can add that crop and leave variety blank. 

### How do I deal with Plantings that are grown in a climate controlled environment for their entire lifecycle?

One option is to designate a garden bed for these plantings.  For example, you might define a bed called "GH" (for Greenhouse).

Another option is to create a separate Garden for these plantings.  

### How do I track perennials?

Perennials can be added as new Plantings each season to track harvest periods.  To add a perennial plant as a Planting, add a new planting for the perennial with the Start Date equal to the First Harvest Date and the Pull Date equal to the End Harvest Date.

Filtering by that perennial crop lets you see how harvest periods compared year to year.

### How do I add transplants to my garden that I didn't grow?

Sometimes you may buy or get gifted seedlings that you didn't start from seed yourself.  In this case, you can add a planting for the transplant with the Start Date equal to the Transplant Date.  

### How do I define a Planting when I don't know the bed?

If you want to add a Planting to your garden plan, but aren't yet sure of the bed, you can create a bed called (say) "TEMP" to hold these plantings.  These plantings can later be reassigned to a different bed.
