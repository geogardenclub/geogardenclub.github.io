# Varieties

:::tip About varieties
:::

There is a single Variety database that is shared by all GeoGardenClub chapters.

## Variety Index

To see all defined Varieties, go to the Drawer and select "Varieties" to display the Variety Index screen:

Use the pulldown menu to quickly access a specific Variety rather than scrolling. The Sort By dropdown allows you to order the list by various criteria (Number of Gardens, Number of Gardeners, etc).

## Create a Variety

:::warning Please capitalize varieties
When adding a new Variety, please capitalize each word for consistency with other Variety names. 

Note that every Crop is automatically defined with an "Unknown" Variety, and you might choose that instead if you're not sure of the Variety.
:::

There are two ways to add a Variety.  First, when you are adding a Planting, you can add a Variety from the Add Planting form. See the [Add Planting documentation](plantings.md#create-a-planting) for details.

The second way is from the Variety Index screen. Tap the "+ Variety" button to bring up the Create Variety screen:

## Gold status

If a Variety has been planted several times and excellent outcomes have been recorded, then it can be accorded "Gold" status. For example:

Once a Variety has achieved Gold status, its Chip will be displayed with a gold background color:
