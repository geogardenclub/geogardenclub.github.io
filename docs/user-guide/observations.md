# Observations

:::tip How to create, update, or delete an observation.
:::

GGC allows gardeners to make "observations" regarding a planting of a plant variety on a specific day.  Observations can include phenomena such as successful germination, first flower, first harvest, diseases, or pests, document outcomes like yields, or simply record the progress of a planting.

## Viewing all Chapter Observations

From the side navigation menu, tap **Home** then tap **Observations** in the bottom navigation menu.  A scrollable display of all observations from all chapter gardens will be displayed.  The garden, gardener, and tag chips are all tapable.

 - **Garden chip:** Tap the garden chip to go that garden's **Garden Summary Screen.**
 - **Gardener chip:** Tap the gardener chip to go to that gardener's **Gardener Summary Screen.**
 - **Tag chip:** Tap the tag chip to see other observations that include that tag.

## Viewing Observations for a specific planting

All observations connected to a planting will be displayed in the **Planting Details Screen.**  To view the **Planting Details Screen,** navigate to the garden in which the planting is located.  Tap the planting bar for the planting you are interested in.

The **Planting Details Screen** will be displayed, first showing info about that planting, followed by a scrollable list of the planting observations.

Fill out the **Create Observation Screen.**  The app will fill in some fields automatically, such as Garden, Bed, Crop, and Variety.

 - **Picture:** Tap the camera icon to take a picture of the planting or tap the gallery icon to select a picture from your device's gallery.
 - **Description:**  Describe the observation.  What is happening?  Do you have theories or questions other gardeners might be able to help with?
 - **Observation Date:** If you are adding an observation for a date other than today, tap the date to select a different date.
 - **Tags:** Add tags to make your observation easily filterable.  Tags are also important if you want that observation to satisfy a requirement of a badge.  For more on badges, see the [Badges](/docs/user-guide/badges) section.
 - **Is this a private observation?** If you don't want other chapter gardeners to see your observation, select this box.

Tap **Submit** to add the observation to the planting or **Cancel** to return to the **Planting Details Screen.**

## Editing an Observation

If you'd like to edit an observation that has already been created, tap the three dots on the upper right of the **Observation Card** and select **Update Observation.**

_Note that if you need to change the garden, bed, crop, or variety of the observation, you will need to delete the observation and create a new one._

Edit the title, description, tags, observation date, or privacy settings and then hit **Submit** to save your changes or **Cancel** to return to the **Planting Details Screen.**
