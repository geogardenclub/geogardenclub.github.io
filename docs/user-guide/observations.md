# Observations

:::tip How (and why) to define Observations
:::

Gaining insight into your gardening practice usually requires more than just recording what crops and varieties you grew and the dates you planted or harvested them. 

You might want to record what the plant looked like when it germinated, or the appearance of the harvest, or a particular pest that appeared at some point in the season.  You might simply want to capture a particularly beautiful moment in your garden.  Observations provide a mechanism to collect data about all of these things and more.  

Observations can be public or private. A public Observation can be seen by anyone in your Chapter. A private Observation can only be seen by you. 


## Viewing observations

### ... for the Chapter

To see all of your Observations, as well as the public Observations by everyone else in your Chapter, tap the "Observations" icon in the bottom nav bar of your Home screen:

Observation are listed in reverse chronological order, so the most recent Observation is at the top. There are "chips" for the Garden, Gardener, Crop, and Variety associated with the Observation. You can tap these to go to the screens associated with these entities. 

### ... for a Planting

You can see the Observations associated with a Planting by going to its Planting Details screen. For example:

## Create an Observation

Observations can be made about Gardens, Beds, Crops, Varieties, or Plantings. 

### ... for a Garden, Bed, Crop, or Variety

To create an Observation for anything other than a Planting, go to the Observations view of your Home Screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/observations-view.png"/>

Now tap the "+ Observation" button to go to the Create Observation screen:

<img width="300" src="/img/user-guide/create-observation.png"/>

Fill out the form as follows:

**Observation Type:** Select the observation type: Garden, Bed, Crop, or Variety .  If the observation is for a Planting, navigate to the planting details card to create an observation (instructions below).

**Garden:** Select the garden the observation is for.

**Picture:** Tap the camera icon to take a picture of the planting or tap the gallery icon to select a picture from your device's gallery.

**Description:**  Describe the observation.  What is happening?  Do you have theories or questions other gardeners might be able to help with?

**Observation Date:** If you are adding an observation for a date other than today, tap the date to select a different date.

**Tags:** Add tags to make your observation easily filterable.  Tags are also important if you want that observation to satisfy a requirement of a badge.  For more on badges, see the [Badges](/docs/user-guide/badges) section.

**Is this a private observation?** If you don't want other Gardeners to see your observation, check this box.

Tap "Submit" to define the Observation.
