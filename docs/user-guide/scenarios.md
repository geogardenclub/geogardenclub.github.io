# Planting Scenarios

:::tip How to accommodate diverse planting scenarios.
:::

## Growing plants in a greenhouse or other climate controlled environment

Plantings may spend time in a greenhouse or other climate controlled environment for some or all of their lifecycle.  

### Plantings that are started in a climate controlled environment and then transplanted to the garden

Planting with a transplant date will assume the time prior the plant was kept "indoors" - either in a greenhouse or other climate-controlled environment.

### Plantings that are grown in a climate controlled environment for their entire lifecycle

One option is to designate a garden bed for these plantings.  In this example, the gardener calls this bed "GH."

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

Another option is to create a separate garden for these plantings.  In the example below, the gardener designated a "Greenhouse" garden.

## Adding perennials as a planting

Perennials can be added as plantings to track harvest periods.  To add a perennial plant as a Planting, add a new planting for the perennial with the Start Date equal to the First Harvest Date and the Pull Date equal to the End Harvest Date.

Filtering by that perennial crop lets you see how harvest periods compared year to year.

## Adding transplants to your garden that you didn't grow yourself

Sometimes you may buy or get gifted seedlings that you didn't start from seed yourself.  In this case, you can add a planting for the transplant with the Start Date equal to the Transplant Date.  

## Adding plantings before the garden bed is known

If you want to add a planting to your garden plans, but aren't yet sure of the bed, you can create a MISC bed to hold these plantings.  Plantings can later be reassigned to a different bed.

## Adding plantings for which the variety is unknown

There are two scenarios in which you may not know the variety of the crop you are planting.

1.  If you are planning for the upcoming season, you may choose to leave the "varieties" field blank, and it will be represented in the format Tomato(Unknown). Once you've decided the variety, you can update the planting to include it.
