# Planting Scenarios

Geo Garden Club is designed to accommodate the various strategies used to grow vegetable crops.  Here are some common scenarios that gardeners may encounter and how to use Geo Garden Club to track these types of plantings.

## Growing plants in a greenhouse or other climate controlled environment

Plantings may spend time in a greenhouse or other climate controlled environment for some or all of their lifecycle.  

### Plantings that are started in a climate controlled environment and then transplanted to the garden

Check the Used Greenhouse box in Create or Update Planting Screens to indicate that the planting was started in a greenhouse.  Then add a transplant date for the actual or projected date the planting will be moved into the garden bed.  The planting's Bed should be the bed in which the transplant will be placed.

### Plantings that are grown in a climate controlled environment for their entire lifecycle

One option is to designate a garden bed for these plantings.  In the example below, the gardener calls this bed "GH."  Then for all plantings that will be grown in this environment or location, check the Used Greenhouse box in Create or Update Planting Screens and leave the transplant date empty.  You can see from the example that the planting bar still denotes harvest time.

Another option is to create a separate garden for these plantings.  In the example below, the gardener designated a "Greenhouse" garden.  Then for all plantings that will be grown in controlled environment, check the Used Greenhouse box in Create or Update Planting Screens and leave the transplant date empty.

## Adding perennials as a planting

Perennials can be added as plantings to track harvest periods.  To add a perennial plant as a Planting, add a new planting for the perennial with the Start Date equal to the First Harvest Date and the Pull Date equal to the End Harvest Date.

Filtering by that perennial crop lets you see how harvest periods compared year to year.

## Adding transplants to your garden that you didn't grow yourself

Sometimes you may buy or get gifted seedlings that you didn't start from seed yourself.  In this case, you can add a planting for the transplant with the Start Date equal to the Transplant Date and the Pull Date equal to the End Harvest Date.  

## Adding plantings before the garden bed is known

If you want to add a planting to your garden plans, but aren't yet sure of the bed, you can create a MISC bed to hold these plantings.  PLantings can later be reassigned to a different bed.
