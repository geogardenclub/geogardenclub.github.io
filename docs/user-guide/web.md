Once you have signed up for GGC using the mobile app, you will be able to access your account via our web app at: https://geogardenclub.app.

As noted on the login page, it is not possible to register an account for GGC through the web. 

Once you have a GGC account, just use your email address and password to login in the normal fashion, which will take you to your home page just like on mobile:

You will find all the features of the mobile app available through the web, but organized more appropriately for a wide screen format. The web platform provides:

* A horizontal navigation bar instead of a vertical Drawer.

* A side navigation bar rather than a bottom navigation bar.

* Multiple columns for screens that display a list of entities.
