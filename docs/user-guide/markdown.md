# Markdown

Whenever you are writing descriptive text (such as in the Notes field of a Planting, or a Forum post, or an Observation description), you can use a syntax called "Markdown" to style the text.  Here are a few of the features supported by Markdown:

### Italic Text  

To display text in italics, surround it with an asterisk. For example, `*My Garden*` is displayed as *My Garden*.

### Bold Text

To display text in bold face, surround it with two asterisks. For example, `**My Garden**` is displayed as **My Garden**.

### Lists

You can create lists two ways. To create an unenumerated list, start each line of the list with an asterisk. For example:

```
* An item
* Another item
* Yet another item
```

displays as:

* An item
* Another item
* Yet another item

To create an enumerated list, start each line with a number and a period. For example:

```
1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. Third thing
```

displays as:

1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. Third thing

### Links

To provide links to other pages on the Internet, you have two options. 

First, you can just paste the address of the page (i.e. the URL), and it will be made clickable. For example, if you paste `https://geogardenclub.com`, it will be formatted as https://geogardenclub.com.

If you want to present a text label for the URL that is clickable, then you put the label in square brackets, and the URL in parentheses *immediately following* the square brackets (without any spaces). So, for example, 

```
[GGC Website](https://geogardenclub.com)
```

will be formatted as [GGC Website](https://geogardenclub.com).

## For more information

While the above formats are probably sufficient for most of your notes, there are lots of other formatting directives for Markdown. If you want to learn more, you can consult [Become a Markdown God--And Fast](https://medium.com/@wdkaiser/become-a-markdown-god-and-fast-74cfdce183e).
