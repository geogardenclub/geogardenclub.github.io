## Create User Profile Screen

<img style={{float: "left", padding: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/user-guide/create-user-profile.png"/>

 - **UserID:** This is a read-only field that displays the email address you used when you registered in the previous screen.
 - **Country:** During the beta test, all GGC chapters are restricted to the United States, so this is a read-only field that displays "United States".  
 - **Postal Code:** Select your postal (zip) code from the drop-down list.
 - **Picture:** Tap the camera icon to take a picture of your garden or tap the gallery icon to select a picture from your device's gallery.
 - **Username:** Choose a username. This will be displayed to other users.  For example: @gardenerbob.  Note that usernames must be unique, so if that name is taken, you will be asked to choose another one after you click "Submit".
 - **Full Name:** Enter your full name.  This is for administrative purposes and will not be shared with other users.
 - **Completed Permaculture Workshop:** If you have formal education in permaculture, select this box.  Completion of a permaculture workshop is required for those wanting the Permaculture Pro badge.  For more on badges, see the [Badges](/docs/user-guide/badges) section.
 - Tap the **Submit** button to create your user profile.
