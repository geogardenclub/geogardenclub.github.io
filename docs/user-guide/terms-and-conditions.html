<p><strong>Counter Notification</strong></p>
<p>If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the Services as a result of a mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification to [us/our Designated Copyright Agent] using the contact information provided below (a &quot;Counter Notification&quot;).
