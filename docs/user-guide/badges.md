## Why Badges?

Badges are a fun way to track all of your gardening practices and skills.  They are also a way to share your level of gardening experience with other users and an incentive for making observations.  Badges are displayed on your profile and are visible to other users.

## Different types of Badges

Badges are specific to either the garden, gardener, or chapter.  Currently, there are three levels for each badge, each requiring increased experience and documentation through observations.

For example, the Compost Champion Badge is a gardener specific badge.  It requires that the gardener document experience with composting by tagging observations with the tags #Compost, #CompostTea, #HugelCulture, #VermiCulture, or #Worms.

 - **Level 1:** The gardener has documented one observation with an associated tag during the current or previous year.
 - **Level 2:** The gardener has documented one observation with an associated tag during the current and two or three prior years.
 - **Level 3:** The gardener has documented one observation with an associated tag during the current at least four prior years.

## Badge Index

Open the side navigation menu and select Badges to view the **Badge Index Screen.** The **Badge Index Screen** displays all badges, requirements, and which gardeners have that badge.  Use the Show/Hide Sections to have the information you are interested in automatically displayed for each badge. The bottom menu allows you to toggle between Garden, Gardener, and Chapter badges.

## How to earn Badges

Tag your observations with the appropriate tags to earn badges.  For example, to earn the Compost Champion Badge, tag your observations with #Compost, #CompostTea, #HugelCulture, #VermiCulture, or #Worms.  The app will automatically track your progress and award you the badge when you have met the requirements.

_You can add or subtract tags to your observations by [Updating the observation](/docs/user-guide/observations#editing-an-observation) after it has been created._
