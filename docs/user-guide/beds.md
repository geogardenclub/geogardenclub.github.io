# Beds

:::tip Managing beds
:::



If you have more than one bed in your garden, they can be added in the **Timeline Screen.**  To get to the **Timeline Screen** tap the **Details** button for the garden you want to add a bed to in the **Home/Gardens Screen.**  This will take you to the **Timeline Screen.**  Tap the + button in the bottom right corner and select **+ Bed** to open the **Create Bed Screen.**  Fill out the form and hit submit.

## Update or delete a bed

Sometimes you make a mistake: you either named the bed incorrectly, or you don't want it in your garden at all.  To fix either of these problems, go to the **Timeline Screen,** then tap a bed chip to go to a screen that lets you update its name or delete it (by clicking on the trash icon in the top right area of the screen).
