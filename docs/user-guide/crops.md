# Crops

:::tip About Crops
:::

There is a single Crop database that is shared by all GeoGardenClub chapters. 

## Crop Index

You can see all the currently defined Crops by going to the Drawer and selecting "Crops" to display the Crop Index screen:

Use the pulldown menu to quickly access a specific Crop rather than scrolling. The Show/Hide Sections allows you to see only certain sections of each Crop.

## Create a Crop

:::warning Please avoid duplication
Please check carefully to see that your Crop is not already defined. Some Crops are known by more than one name: Corn (Maize), Squash (Pumpkin), Yam (Sweet Potato), Bok Choy (Pak Choi)
:::

There are two ways to add a Crop.  First, when you are adding a Planting, you can add a Crop from the Add Planting form. See the [Add Planting documentation](plantings.md#create-a-planting) for details.

The second way is from the Crop Index screen. Click the "+ Crop" button to bring up the Create Crop screen:
