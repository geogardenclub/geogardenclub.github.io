# Crops

:::tip About Crops
:::

There is a single Crop database that is shared by all GeoGardenClub chapters. 

## Crop Index

You can see all the currently defined Crops by going to the Drawer and selecting "Crops" to display the Crop Index screen:

Use the pulldown menu to quickly access a specific Crop rather than scrolling. The Sort By dropdown allows you to order the list by various criteria (Number of Varieties, Number of Gardens, etc).

## Create a Crop

:::warning Please avoid duplication
Before creating a new Crop, please check carefully to see that your Crop is not already defined. Some issues to be aware of: 

* Some crops have more than one name. For example: Corn and Maize.
* Some crops have a Chapter-local name. For example: Breadfruit is listed as 'Ulu in the Hawaii chapters.
* Zucchini is its own Crop (not a Variety of Summer Squash).
* Pumpkin is its own Crop (not a Variety of Winter Squash).

There are two ways to add a Crop.  First, when you are adding a Planting, you can add a Crop from the Add Planting form. See the [Add Planting documentation](plantings.md#create-a-planting) for details.

The second way is from the Crop Index screen. Tap the "+ Crop" button.

Whichever way you do it, the result is the Create Crop screen:

**Crop Name**. Crop names must be unique. Please capitalize the crop name. We prefer the Crop name to be the "common" name.

**Family**. Select the Family associated with this Crop.  If you don't know the Family, you can select "Unknown".

**Quantity Unit**. This is a text string that indicates how quantities of this crop are typically represented.  The most common units are "lbs" or "pieces".

**Chapter**. This defaults to your Chapter.

**Chapter Local Name**.  Provide a value for this field only if your Chapter typically refers to a Crop by something other than its common name. For example, in Hawaii Chapters, "Breadfruit" is known as "'Ulu".  Leave this blank if your Chapter uses the common name.
