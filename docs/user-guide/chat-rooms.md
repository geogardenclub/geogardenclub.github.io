:::tip How to use chat rooms and where to find them.
:::

GGC allows gardeners to communicate with each other through chat rooms.  Chat rooms are a great way to ask questions, share knowledge, and build community.  Chat rooms are organized by chapter or garden.

## Where to find chat rooms

Chat rooms are found in the **Home** section.  From the side navigation menu select **Home.**  Chat is located in the bottom navigation menu of the **Home Screens**.  Tap **Chat** to view chat rooms for your chapter and the gardens you are an owner or editor of.

## Chat room etiquette

- Be respectful and kind.
- Keep the conversation on topic and mostly gardening related.
- If you have a question, ask it!  If you have an answer, share it!
