# Chat Rooms

:::tip How (and why) to use Chat Rooms
:::

Sometimes you want to ask another Gardener a question. For example, you are looking at their Garden plan and wonder why they started their Basil so late in the season.  Or, they recorded amazing Outcomes for a Planting that didn't work well at all for you, and you want to try to figure out what they did right and you did wrong. 

GeoGardenClub provides one "Chapter" Chat Room and individual "Garden" Chat Rooms for each Garden in the Chapter. These are "public" Chat Rooms, in that every Gardener has access to every Chat Room. 

:::info No sliding into DMs
GeoGardenClub does not implement "one-on-one" chatting---you can't direct message another gardener. 
:::

Chat Rooms are automatically created and maintained; you do not have to create or delete Chat Rooms.

## Viewing Chat Rooms

To see the Chat Rooms, go to your Home screen and tap the "Chat" icon in the bottom nav bar to bring up the Chat Room view:

Note that this view has two tabs. The "My Chats" tab is displayed by default and shows the Chapter Chat Room and the Chat Room(s) for your Gardens. 

Tap the "All Chats" tab to show all the Chat Rooms in this Chapter, including the Chat Rooms for all Gardens. 

## Chat room etiquette

* Be respectful and kind.
* Keep the conversation on topic and mostly gardening related.
* If you have a question, ask it!  If you have an answer, share it!
* If you feel that a gardener is posting inappropriate content to a Chat Room, please email info@geogardenclub.com and we will take appropriate action.
