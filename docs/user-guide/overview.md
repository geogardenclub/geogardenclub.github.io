# Welcome to the GGC User Guide

We designed the GeoGardenClub app (GGC) to provide:

1. *A sophisticated, but easy to use app for home produce gardens.*  GGC allows gardeners to create and manage multiple gardens over multiple years, and to easily collect share data that improves garden practices and productivity.

2. *Useful mechanisms for community building.* Beyond individual gardener support, GGC provides ways to help local gardeners connect with and learn from each other. 

3. *Increased local community food resilience*. GGC improves local community food resilience by increasing the success of local home gardeners.

Enjoy!
