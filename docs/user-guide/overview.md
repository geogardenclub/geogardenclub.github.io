# Overview

Welcome to the User Guide for the GeoGardenClub app. 

The GeoGardenClub app is designed to support two primary goals:

1. *Provide a sophisticated, but easy to use garden planning app.*  The GGC App is designed to allow gardeners to create and manage multiple gardens over multiple years, and to easily collect Observations and Outcome data that enable them to gain insight and improve their garden practices and productivity. 

2. *Provide a mechanism for community building for gardeners in a local area.* The GGC App provides a variety of mechanisms to help gardeners connect with each other. At the simplest level, gardeners can see each other's garden plans and what they are planting and whether the planting was successful or not. At higher levels, they can chat with each other and share seeds, plantings, food, and other resources. 

As you go through this guide, keep in mind these two goals which motivate the design and implementation. 

Enjoy!
