# Welcome to the GGC User Guide

We designed the GeoGardenClub app (GGC) to support the following goals:

1. *Provide a sophisticated, but easy to use app for home produce gardens.*  GGC allows individual gardeners to create and manage multiple gardens over multiple years, and to easily collect Observations and Outcome data that enable them to gain insight and improve their garden practices and productivity.

2. *Provide useful mechanisms for community building for gardeners in a local area.* Beyond individual gardener support, GGC provides a variety of mechanisms to help gardeners in a local geographic are to connect with and learn from each other. 

3. *Significantly improve local community food resilience in multiple geographic regions*. We believe this will happen because the GGC is designed to help increase both the number of local home gardeners and their productivity. 

As you go through this guide, please keep in mind these goals which have motivated the design and implementation of the app. 

Enjoy!
