# Overview
Geo Garden Club is more than just a garden planning app; it's a community-building platform designed to enhance garden management while fostering local camaraderie. Seamlessly connect with fellow gardeners in your area to exchange plans, insights, and seeds. With practical planning tools and intuitive record-keeping features, Geo Garden Club empowers you to learn from both triumphs and setbacks.   Geo Garden Club was built upon these core beliefs:

## Local insights matter
Upon registration, Geo Garden Club assigns you to a local chapter based on your zip code, ensuring that you access relevant gardening data and observations. Tap into chapter-wide outcomes to discover local best practices and optimal planting times tailored to _your area._

## Gardens aren't always solitary endeavors
Embrace teamwork by granting "edit" access to fellow gardeners, sharing the workload effortlessly. Stay connected with chapter members through notifications and shared observations. Engage in focused conversations via garden and chapter-based chat rooms, facilitating seamless communication and knowledge exchange.

## Historical data is valuable
Gain invaluable insights from previous gardening seasons with the multi-year Timeline Screen. Filter your planting timelines by crop, bed, family, or variety, to build on successes and avoid past pitfalls fostering continuous improvement. 

## Gardening extends beyond a single season
Recognizing that gardens span multiple years and crops aren't restricted to summer alone, the multi-year Timeline Screen is designed to accommodate a diverse range of planting schedules. From winter crops to perennials and biennials, this feature empowers gardeners to plan effectively for all types of crops throughout the year.

## Seed saving and sharing builds resiliency
Incorporating seed saving into planting timelines ensures accurate space allocation for each crop. Explore and contribute to the chapter's seed database, reviewing outcomes and planting timelines to make informed decisions. Connect with fellow gardeners offering seeds, fostering a culture of resilience and resource sharing.
