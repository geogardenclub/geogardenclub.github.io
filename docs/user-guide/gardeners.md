# Gardeners

:::tip How (and why) to look at Gardeners
:::

Let's say you are interested in growing Corn for the first time, and you want to contact someone in your Chapter with experience growing that crop. 

The Gardener Index screen enables you to peruse the Gardeners in your Chapter and find people with experience in various crops and varieties. 

## Gardener Index

You can see a list of all the Gardeners in your Chapter by going to the Drawer and selecting "Gardeners" to display the Gardener Index screen:

Use the pulldown menu to quickly access a specific Gardener rather than scrolling. The Show/Hide Sections allows you to see only certain sections pertaining to each Gardener.
