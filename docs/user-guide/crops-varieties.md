# Add Crops and Varieties to the Chapter Database

:::tip How to add crops and varieties to the database.

The crops and varieties in each chapter's database are crowdsourced from the chapter's members.  This ensures that the database is exclusive to what is grown in the area.  A crop or variety can be added when making a new planting, or in the **Crops and Varieties Index Screen** located in the side navigation menu.
