## Create a Crop

:::warning Please avoid duplication
Please check carefully to see that your Crop is not already defined. Some Crops are known by more than one name: Corn (Maize), Squash (Pumpkin), Yam (Sweet Potato), Bok Choy (Pak Choi)
:::

There are two ways to add a Crop.  First, when you are adding a Planting, you can add a Crop from the Add Planting form. See the [Add Planting documentation](plantings.md#create-a-planting) for details.

The second way is from the Crop Index screen. Click the "+ Crop" button to bring up the Create Crop screen:

## Create a Variety

:::warning Please capitalize varieties
When adding a new Variety, please capitalize each word for consistency with other Variety names. 

Note that every Crop is automatically defined with an "Unknown" Variety, and you might choose that instead if you're not sure of the Variety.
