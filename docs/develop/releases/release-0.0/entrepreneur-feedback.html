<p>Hi Philip,</p>
<p>Again, apologies for missing your first email. I watched the AGC app video. It&#x27;s a promising idea. Here are my thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>For an app like this I recommend a freemium model. In the beginning you really need to concentrate on wide adoption, and that requires a free version, which can still generate revenue via ads. The paid version should offer things like Garden Kumu, which is a service where a professional answers questions from gardeners submitted via the app. It could also provide access to a knowledge base of all previous answers for questions submitted to Garden Kumu. Based on my experience I think the paid version should be around $4 per month.</li>
<li>Even though you are targeting serious gardeners you need to make it fun. Add contests like biggest pumpkin for Halloween, most beautiful squash for Thanksgiving, etc. This kind of contest is relatively easy to implement and will significantly increase the appeal of the app.</li>
<li>Make it social. Chapters should have message boards, photo sharing, etc.</li>
<li>Provide garden challenges and have badges for accomplishments such as starting a new garden, successfully growing a difficult crop and weathering a challenge (e.g. insect infestation.)</li>
<li>Make sure the app is localization friendly so you can easily add Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Hawaiian. In addition to native speakers many people will be interested in gardening-related Hawaiian terms.</li>
<li>Consider partnering with farmers markets and / or coops like Kokua to provide a place for gardeners to take excess produce. Note: I think many of them will give the excess produce to neighbors, but some will be interested in selling it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think your demographic is going to be young. Most older gardeners have strongly established routines and their own networks. They probably won&#x27;t buy the app unless it&#x27;s for the purpose of helping younger gardeners or possibly to participate in contests.</p>
<p>I hope this advice is helpful. AGC seems like a great project. I wish you and your team success! Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.</p>
<hr>
<p>From: Philip Johnson</p>
<p>Hi E1,</p>
<p>I really appreciate your time to review our project and provide such helpful comments. I am cc&#x27;ing Jenna (co-founder and my daughter!) on this reply.</p>
<p>Both Jenna and I agree emphatically with all your comments!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We plan to offer at least 6-9 months free use of the app for new users---essentially allowing folks to use it for one gardening season without cost.  Our idea is that after that time, they will have entered a significant amount of their own gardening data into the app, resulting in a subtle kind of &quot;lock in&quot;.  While we&#x27;ll provide them with the ability to export their data as CSV at the end of the free trial if they decide they don&#x27;t want to continue, our goal is to provide enough utility that they&#x27;ll be happy to continue on with a paid subscription rather than revert to what they did before.  So, that&#x27;s our current variant of a freemium model. If we find too many people quitting after six months, then we could go to a free version with ads, but I&#x27;d really like to avoid ads for a variety of reasons if we can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are so right that &quot;serious gardener&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;no fun required gardener&quot;!  We&#x27;ve thought about a variety of game mechanics (badges, contests, etc).  Another angle is citizen science: there are various climate and environmental groups that have campaigns where gardeners could provide useful observations about plant growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your suggestion to make it social is also spot on.  One primary goal of the app is to foster a high quality &quot;community of practice&quot; around gardening in a given geographic region.  The ability to message others within the app and easily share gardening data is going to be key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding photos, the app will support taking photos (tagged to the garden and plant varietal) that can be shared. In fact, one thing we learned is that if we provide a kind of &quot;Garden Instagram&quot; within the app, then some folks who aren&#x27;t even gardeners said they would subscribe to the app simply to see what their friends were doing in their gardens. We also know (from Jenna&#x27;s personal experience) that gardeners like to share pictures of their gardens and particularly beautiful/interesting plants.  So, having a garden-specific &quot;feed&quot; seems like a fun and attractive feature. We didn&#x27;t present this idea because we believe that by itself, it&#x27;s not enough to make the application viable. We first have to nail the ability to support gardeners in planning and execution of their garden first.  If we can succeed there, then the Garden Instagram feature will be icing on the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, we agree about the opportunities for partnering and sharing. We think the app can informally facilitate lots of cooperation: some folks could (for example) coordinate their succession planting with each other so that everyone always has (for example) a good supply of lettuce. There is also a huge opportunity for seed sharing. This is exciting, because locally grown seeds are often going to be better adapted to local conditions (natural selection!).  In fact, Jenna is presenting our idea to a seed saving/sharing organization in the near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, yes, our target demographic is Millenials and Gen Z. Thankfully, Jenna is a millennial.  We eventually need to get someone even younger on the team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for &quot;Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.&quot; Actually, I already have something in mind.  I&#x27;ve been getting up to speed with Flutter and am now more-or-less competent with creating CRUD apps using Riverpod and Firebase and pushing them out to TestFlight.  I want to make some more progress on an initial MVP, but at some point I would like to ask you to take a look at the UI and code and let me know where we&#x27;re going terribly, terribly wrong. :)  Probably early summer. I propose to take you out to lunch to discuss the results of the code review.</p>
<p>Thanks again,
Philip</p>
<hr>
<p>Hi Philip,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m happy I could contribute some ideas. I suspected you were already doing many of those things :-) Jenna - It&#x27;s nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Comments are below.</p>
<p><em>We plan to offer at least 6-9 months free use of the app for new users---essentially allowing folks to use it for one gardening season without cost.  Our idea is that after that time, they will have entered a significant amount of their own gardening data into the app, resulting in a subtle kind of &quot;lock in&quot;.</em></p>
<p>That makes sense. You can do this for Apple App Store and Google Play apps via promo codes. Make sure to create a paid app, and then use promo codes because you can&#x27;t convert a free app to a paid app.</p>
<p><em>If we find too many people quitting after six months, then we could go to a free version with ads, but I&#x27;d really like to avoid ads for a variety of reasons if we can.</em></p>
<p>I&#x27;m also not a fan of using ads, but some companies don&#x27;t have any other revenue model. I think AGC probably does if you can build a good premium service. For a subscription service you really need to concentrate on providing ongoing and ever-improving services such as Garden Kumu, gamification (e.g. contests, challenges, badges) and locale specific guidance from AGC experts and senior chapter members.</p>
<p>I suggest providing strong incentives for senior chapter members to share their knowledge. In addition to recognition for status via badges you might want to provide things like coupons for Kokua Coop, Leahi Health, etc. You may also want to (quietly) waive or discount their subscription fees.</p>
<p><em>You are so right that &quot;serious gardener&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;no fun required gardener&quot;!  We&#x27;ve thought about a variety of game mechanics (badges, contests, etc).  Another angle is citizen science: there are various climate and environmental groups that have campaigns where gardeners could provide useful observations about plant growth.</em></p>
<p>That is a good idea. I would ask if you can list them as partners. It would be nice to have a list of collaborating green companies / nonprofits on your site. This lends credibility.</p>
<p><em>Your suggestion to make it social is also spot on.  One primary goal of the app is to foster a high quality &quot;community of practice&quot; around gardening in a given geographic region.  The ability to message others within the app and easily share gardening data is going to be key.</em></p>
<p>I agree. People often underestimate the effort in putting a community together on a proprietary platform. It can be done, but it&#x27;s a lot of work both from a technology and a community growth / management perspective. The devil is in the details.</p>
<p><em>Regarding photos, the app will support taking photos (tagged to the garden and plant varietal) that can be shared. In fact, one thing we learned is that if we provide a kind of &quot;Garden Instagram&quot; within the app, then some folks who aren&#x27;t even gardeners said they would subscribe to the app simply to see what their friends were doing in their gardens.</em></p>
<p>That is a great idea. Lots of people are interested in gardening but can&#x27;t participate because they don&#x27;t have land and / or time.</p>
<p><em>We also know (from Jenna&#x27;s personal experience) that gardeners like to share pictures of their gardens and particularly beautiful/interesting plants.  So, having a garden-specific &quot;feed&quot; seems like a fun and attractive feature. We didn&#x27;t present this idea because we believe that by itself, it&#x27;s not enough to make the application viable. We first have to nail the ability to support gardeners in planning and execution of their garden first.  If we can succeed there, then the Garden Instagram feature will be icing on the top.</em></p>
<p>That makes sense. The main reason companies like this fail is simply failure to launch. They fail to scope an MVP that addresses the 20% of their ideas that are critical to early success.</p>
<p><em>Yes, we agree about the opportunities for partnering and sharing. We think the app can informally facilitate lots of cooperation: some folks could (for example) coordinate their succession planting with each other so that everyone always has (for example) a good supply of lettuce.

In fact, Jenna is presenting our idea to a seed saving/sharing organization in the near future.</em></p>
<p>True. Communities in rural Japan are very good at this. They share seeds, they give excess produce to neighbors, and just generally function as a unified community gardening engine.</p>
<p><em>And, yes, our target demographic is Millenials and Gen Z. Thankfully, Jenna is a millennial.</em></p>
<p>👍</p>
<p><em>We eventually need to get someone even younger on the team.</em></p>
<p>:-) My 9 you is a very serious gardener. He has been trained well by grandma. Noa knows how to plant seeds with the right spacing and depth for a given plant, handle watering, fertilizing, cultivating, etc. They can start young!</p>
<p><em>Thank you for &quot;Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.&quot; Actually, I already have something in mind.  I&#x27;ve been getting up to speed with Flutter and am now more-or-less competent with creating CRUD apps using Riverpod and Firebase and pushing them out to TestFlight.  I want to make some more progress on an initial MVP, but at some point I would like to ask you to take a look at the UI and code and let me know where we&#x27;re going terribly, terribly wrong. :)  Probably early summer. I propose to take you out to lunch to discuss the results of the code review.</em></p>
<p>No problem. I&#x27;ve personally been doing SwiftUI work, but we have three excellent Flutter developers at Ikayzo. I&#x27;ve also been doing lots of app design / branding and UXD work (examples from our flamboyant Niftia customer attached.)</p>

<p>Hi E1,</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback and tips!  You mentioned how in rural Japan gardeners operate as a &quot;unified community gardening engine&quot; and that is exactly what this technology aims to do.  Do I need to plan a trip to Japan to research?  Obviously yes.  ;)</p>
<p>I appreciated the emphasis on gamification - contests, badges, incentives for good recording of growing data and how that can intersect with community building.  I have Spotify and love their &quot;Wrapped&quot; year in review.  Getting interesting stats about your growing habits could be a fun element to add down the line (once we have growing habits to aggregate data from!) and could be provided in a shareable format.</p>
<p>I love the cross generational passing of skills between your child and his grandma!  I really enjoyed working with kids in school gardens and often it was the grandparents who were most engaged with the garden.  It makes me think - this technology could help the youth document the gardening practices and of their elders.  What important data to record!</p>
<p>Very cool Niftia design! So sleek and who doesn&#x27;t love a peacock?  Made me want to visit the site to learn more.  NFTs!</p>
<p>Thanks again,
Jenna</p>

<p>Absolutely. I recommend doing your research in Okinawa at the Club Med in Ishigaki. There are plenty of people with gardens in the vicinity. It will be rough, but someone has to do it.</p>

<p>That sounds great. I&#x27;d like to have that data for our community garden and grandma&#x27;s gardens.</p>
<p><em>I love the cross generational passing of skills between your child and his grandma!</em></p>
<p>:-) It is a precious thing. She taught him all kinds of interesting things like how to find bamboo shoots that are the right size for digging up, and how to prepare and cook them. They are an amazing bright purple.</p>
<p><em>I really enjoyed working with kids in school gardens</em></p>
<p>That is a lot of fun, and it&#x27;s a great opportunity to teach botany, chemistry, entomology and a dozen other things! Also, after spending all day on a computer, it&#x27;s nice to just sink your hands into the land.</p>
<p><em>and often it was the grandparents who were most engaged with the garden.</em></p>
<p>That is certainly true in our family, and many of our boys&#x27; friends&#x27; families as well. They learn gardening from grandma and / or grandpa.</p>
<p><em>It makes me think - this technology could help the youth document the gardening practices and of their elders.  What important data to record!</em></p>
<p>Absolutely. It is a great opportunity to preserve traditional gardening practices.</p>
<p><em>Very cool Niftia design! So sleek and who doesn&#x27;t love a peacock?  Made me want to visit the site to learn more.  NFTs!</em></p>
<p>Thank you. It was / is a fun project. I think our customer was unlucky with the timing given the precipitous fall in value, but hopefully they&#x27;ll make a comeback. He is very upset that Stephen Colbert makes fun of NFTs every other night. I haven&#x27;t told him Stephen is my favorite comedian.</p>

<p>I had a zoom call with E2 this morning. They seemed pretty enthusiastic about our direction and didn&#x27;t bring up any warning signs about our approach and process.  They had a number of interesting thoughts which I will summarize as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider &quot;local first&quot;. They are building apps that cache data locally first, and then later upload to the web. This can improve performance, but more profoundly, can provide for much more data privacy than a traditional &quot;sync to the cloud immediately&quot; approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They think it&#x27;s important for us to first ensure that we design an app that folks view as a &quot;trusted friend&quot;---that the data is safe, that it will be there for them later in a useful form. Only then will the &quot;social&quot; aspects become relevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They made a very interesting comment---they&#x27;ve recently taken over a plot in a community garden, and wishes there was a way to communicate and coordinate with the other folks in that community.  This is kind of like a &quot;micro-chapter&quot;. I just had the idea that we might want to support hashtags for gardens. Then folks could add #makiki-community-garden (or whatever) to their garden and filter all the analyses by that hashtag. That would basically enable users to self-organize into smaller groups within a chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>GGC looks like a cool project, fun that you get to work with Jenna! It looks like an interesting niche, but getting a critical mass of users seems like it would be challenging in general because of the intersection of serious gardeners and the geographic span of chapters (walking &amp; biking distance!) I would worry that it would be hard to get that combination in many places, since most apps / Internet tools thrive by having few if any geographic boundaries, but that is not possible for GGC (by design). I wonder if you could appeal to both novice &amp; serious gardeners as a way to build community to get to critical mass, and perhaps explore the pathways by which a novice becomes serious (which I assume is a thing).</p>
<p>GGC Motivation page notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would add something about using technology to introduce some of the benefits of community gardening to home gardens to the TL;DR section of the Mo, since that seems like the core problem GGC is attempting to solve.</li>
<li>I think Food Shift has shifted from the term &quot;food deserts&quot; to &quot;food apartheid&quot;, since they are often the result of systemic racism, not just a natural feature of a landscape (though humans make deserts too! 😦</li>
<li>I see the Agile Garden Club name is still in the diagram in the Motivation page</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to try to recapture E4’s excellent napkin points.  All I can remember so far this morning is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid conflating “food resilience” (direct hit for GGC) with “food insecurity” (lots of structural barriers for GGC).</li>
<li>Need more BIPOC representation.</li>
<li>A hyperlocal orientation does not have to preclude other dimensions for data sharing.</li>
<li>First page would be better written in terms of “assets” that GGC wants to help leverage better than they are currently, rather than the current “academic grant proposal introduction section”  (which is the only way I know how to write first pages.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Other points (by E4):</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Include social enterprises that run urban/community farms as part of their programming</li>
<li>use tags for profiling gardening conditions, community types etc to make effective and appropriate global sharing</li>
<li>ensure features in the platform to be able to easily share the harvest (there is significant food wasted at all stages of the food supply chain, starting with community farms).</li>
<li>pair up with nonprofits and write grants. The license fee can be included in the grant</li>
<li>not just BIPOCS but include people with lived experience of food insecurity in the leadership
Btw I read research stating that asset framing language yields more funding (donations and grants) so maybe it works for academic grants, too.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aloha Philip,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m taking a look at the info.</p>
<p>In your outcome data section, the rating criteria is a great idea.  Based on my personal experience, you may consider revising your ratings on pest and disease resistance.  I&#x27;ve seldom seen garden plants without some damage.  In commercial agriculture, with pests you generally do not attempt to control the pest unless it is causing significant economic damage, i.e. a few holes etc are not a reason.  Only if the damage will significantly affect yields.  Home gardeners should not expect fruits and veg to look like they do in the grocery store.</p>
<p>Outcome Appearance- as above they won&#x27;t look like grocery store produce.  Many places are now marketing ugly fruit and veg.  It reduces food waste and cost.  Some of the best tomatoes I&#x27;ve eaten have been ugly but the best tasting.  Just a thought, my citrus is generally ugly due to insect damage on the skins, but the flavor is unaffected.</p>
<p>Seed saving/sharing- The vast majority of seeds have been crossbred for various attributes such as disease resistance, nematode resistance, etc..  The seeds from these plants may or maynot have the same characteristics.  Commercial tomatoes were bred to withstand a 5 mile per hour impact for machine harvesting but they didn&#x27;t bother to consider flavor as a criteria.  Heirloom plants are open pollinated and are what we call pure line in that the seeds from the plants produce very similar to exactly the same genetically.  So, sharing heirloom seeds is good but not hybrid seed.</p>
<p>I see that you have Charlie Reppun on your team.  I don&#x27;t really know him but did hang out with his brother when we lived on the big island.</p>
<p>I hope this was somewhat helpful.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/develop/releases/release-0.0/customer-feedback"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Customer feedback</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/develop/releases/release-0.0/chatgpt-feedback"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">ChatGPT feedback</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#entrepreneur-1-e1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Entrepreneur 1 (E1)</a></li><li><a href="#entrepreneur-2-e2" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Entrepreneur 2 (E2)</a></li><li><a href="#entrepreneur-3-e3" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Entrepreneur 3 (E3)</a></li><li><a href="#entrepreneur-4-e4" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Entrepreneur 4 (E4)</a></li><li><a href="#entrepreneur-5-e5" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Entrepreneur 5 (E5)</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__links text--center"><div class="footer__links"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/geogardenclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Facebook<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/geogardenclub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Instagram<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="https://geogardenclub.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=2c9db5ab59b4602f6c71e2091&amp;id=c75bee0e1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Join the GGC mailing list<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="https://us10.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=2c9db5ab59b4602f6c71e2091&amp;id=c75bee0e1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">News Archive<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Geo Garden Club, LLC</div></div></div></footer></div>
