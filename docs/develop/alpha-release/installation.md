# Installation

## Flutter

Follow the [Flutter Installation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) instructions.

The [Flutterpalooza](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/mobile-application-development/modules/flutterpalooza/) module has some additional documentation. 

It is important that you are able to run `flutter doctor` without error:

```shell
% flutter doctor

## XCode 14.3 configuration

To my great dismay, ggc_app does not build for the iOS simulator using XCode 14.3 without some additional configuration. The only way I have found to get the ggc_app to run on the iOS simulator is by installing the libarclite library manually into XCode.  Here are the steps:

1. *Open the Terminal app and go to the XCode library folder:*
```shell
cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/
```

2. *Allow the Terminal app to create directories in "protected" areas such Applications/.*  To do this, go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access`, and add the Terminal app to the list of apps that have full disk access by toggling the radio button next to the Terminal app.  You will need to enter your password to make this change. Afterwards, the Terminal app will need to restart for these changes to take effect.

3. *Add the libarclite files to the XCode library folder:*
```shell
sudo mkdir arc
cd  arc
sudo git clone https://github.com/kamyarelyasi/Libarclite-Files.git .
sudo chmod +x *
```

:::info Additional shenanigans
The above information should be enough for you to proceed. However, I want to document some additional details in case they become relevant in the future.

First, after doing the above, when trying to deploy to the iOS Simulator, I got an XCode error that  CFBundleVersion was invalid.  I fixed this (and related errors) by editing the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file manually, and setting both CFBundleVersion and CFBundleShortVersionString to "1". Since this file is version controlled, and does not appear to be affected by running `pod install` etc, I don't think you need to worry about it.

Second, this approach to resolving XCode 14.3 problems was found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75924853/2038293). What you see is that the above instructions only resolving building, but not "archiving".  Additional steps are provided to support archiving. Since I don't know anything about archiving, I didn't do this additional step, but I want to note it while I am thing about it. 

Finally, in case we need to look at these changes more closely in the future, the commit is [here](https://github.com/geogardenclub/ggc_app/commit/ef53b52a217ca4eed1307235d8da84dad607c5db).

## ggc_app

To install the app, first clone the sources from <https://github.com/geogardenclub/ggc_app>.

Next, cd into the ggc_app directory and run `flutter pub get`. For example:

```
% flutter pub get

Next, to check that the ggc_app actually runs in your environment, the simplest thing to do is to invoke `flutter run` and select Chrome:

```
% flutter run

```

If all goes well, you should see a window similar to the following appear:

<img src="/img/develop/getting-started/installation-ggc-chrome.png"/>

At this point, you can login as one of the existing users to make sure communication with Firebase is working correctly. Contact Philip for credentials.


## Editor

There are three good choices for your Editor: Visual Studio, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (with the Dart and Flutter plugins, which makes it almost equivalent to Android Studio).

With IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, after bringing up the project, you should see a run toolbar at the top which gives you (on a Mac) the option of opening the iOS simulator:

<img src="/img/develop/getting-started/installation-open-ios.png"/>

After opening the simulator, it should appear and you should be able to emulate the system on an iOS device:

<img src="/img/develop/getting-started/installation-run-ios.png"/>

It takes a couple of minutes to do all of the XCode shenanigans the first time you run it, but eventually you should see something like the following:

<img src="/img/develop/getting-started/installation-run-ios-2.png"/>

As before, consult with Philip for login credentials.

## Monarch

According to their home page, [Monarch](https://monarchapp.io/) is a "tool for building Flutter widgets in isolation. It makes it easy to build, test and debug complex UIs." Monarch is basically a Flutter port of React Storybook, which is tremendously popular in React UI development.

I have begun using Monarch and believe it will be very helpful for GGC UI development. 

Follow the [Monarch installation instructions](https://monarchapp.io/docs/install) to install the tool.

Then, invoke `monarch run --reload hot-restart` (or, for less typing, the `./run_monarch.sh` shell script). 

You will see the Monarch UI appear, which enables you to view all of the GGC UI elements individually, and (where useful) in different states:

<img src="/img/develop/getting-started/monarch.png"/>

Note that you need to manually select our theme (currently, "Green Theme: Light"). Monarch defaults to the Material Light theme when it is first invoked. 

For the design and development of basic UI elements, Monarch appears to be faster, easier, and more efficient than running the iOS simulator.  Creating Monarch stories also creates an easy to browse "catalog" of UI elements which are far easier to review than paging through the emulated system to get to the correct state.
