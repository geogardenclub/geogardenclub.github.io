# Goals

Here are an initial set of goals for the 1.0 (Alpha) release.

## Develop a fast, reliable, robust app that satisfies the Core Value Propositions

By the end of the 1.0 release period, we need to have an app that satisfies the [Core Value Propositions](cvp#the-core-value-propositions) while being fast, easy to use, and not prone to crashing.

Evaluation:
* Checklist of CVP functions satisfied.
* Time to retrieve each page in app using DevTools Performance View 
* Crashlytics data 
* Usability Evaluation of 1.0 user base with respect to app usability.

## Determine what it means to be a champion/chapter chair

Successful chapters will need one or more champions. We need to use the 1.0 release period to develop an understanding of what it means to be champion: what their responsibilities are, how to carry out their responsibilities, and how the GGC organization should support and/or compensate them.

Evaluation criteria:
* User-facing documentation for Chapter Chairs. 

## Provide high quality documentation

We should use the 1.0 release to determine what needs to be documented, and how it should be documented. Some possible documentation sources include:
* In app documentation (the ? icon)
* YouTube (shorts and/or regular videos)
* GGC Discord Server: channels visible to those in the "User" role.

Evaluation criteria:
* Usability evaluation of 1.0 user base with respect to app documentation.

## Develop evidence-based use cases

The 1.0 release period should result in examples of "successful" use of GGC to solve real world problems for gardeners.  Example use cases include:

* The gardener can plan/manage their garden more easily
* The gardener makes better choices for their seeds and/or management of plants
* The garden produces more food
* The garden/gardener incorporates new best practices due to the app

The more empirical this data, the better.  Much of this will require some information about what the garden/gardener was doing before the introduction of GGC.

Evaluation:
* Analysis of "pre" and "post" questionnaires. The pre questionnaires establish what each gardener was doing prior to GGC: what their technologies were, what their pain points were, etc. The post questionnaires establish their feelings after using GGC: what worked, what didn't work, what they wish would be changed about the app.
* Documentation of use cases.
* Evaluation by entreprenurial board members and/or other external stakeholders.

## Integrate AI in a useful manner

AI technologies like ChatGPT impact the viability of our business model. We must be able to show users why they should pay for our app instead of using a generic AI. I believe that the best way to answer this question is to provide access to AI capabilities within the app, and provide concrete use cases of how using AI within the app is better than using AI without the app.

Evaluation:
* Test results of AI within app vs. AI external to app on basic gardening scenarios.
