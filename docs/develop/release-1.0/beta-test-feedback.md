This category groups together the beta test feedback that results from a user having an inadequate understanding of the system to use it correctly or efficiently.

## Business Logic Issues
This category groups together problems that result from the system not processing data according to system requirements for the current implementation.  On the user side, this can result in unexpected behavior, including crashes.  On the developer side, this can result in Integrity Check violations.

## Future Requirement Issues
This category groups together issues raised by users that indicate a desire for additional functionality that is not currently available in the system. They could either be requirements that we foresee for a future release, or requirements that we have never thought of before.

## Design Issues
This category groups together issues that result from users wanting a different approach to the current functionality of the system. This is different from "Future Requirement Issues" (because that refers to additional functionality) or "Business Logic Issues" (because that refers to incorrect implementation of current requirements, not a disagreement with the nature of the requirement).

## UI Layout/Platform Issues
This category groups together problems that result from a user using a phone with different view screen dimensions than we have assumed in our UI design. Text clipping, weird overflow, etc can result from this. Eventually, we can use Monarch to quickly test our layout on a variety of platforms to uncover these issues earlier.
