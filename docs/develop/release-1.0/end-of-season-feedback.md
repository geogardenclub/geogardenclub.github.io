# End of Season Feedback

In September 2024, Jenna sent out an 8 question survey to users to request feedback. We received five responses. Here is a summary of the feedback:

#### Q1: Approximately how many years have you grown a garden?

| Years | Count |
|-------|-------|
| 7+ Years | 3   |
| 1-3 years | 2 |

#### Q2: GGC provides innovative features to increase community food resiliency through improving garden outcomes.  For each of these features, please tell us how much you have utilized it.

| Feature | Don't use | Use a bit | Use a lot | Want to use |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Share data | 1 | 1 | | 3 |
| Access control | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Multiple season history | | 1 | | 4 | 
| Aggregate chapter data | | 2 | | 3 | 
| Observations | 1 | 3 | | 1 |
| Outcomes | | 2 | | 3 |
| Seed saving and sharing | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 |



#### Q3: Please share more feedback about existing features. What do you like and what could be improved?

* So far I really like the function, I do feel that navigating the ui takes a small bit of learning but it's not hard. I'll definitely use more consistently I'm not trying to catch up in the middle of the season
* I provided a lot of feedback via the chat group.
* I like being able to see what others have planted and when they planted it. And I look forward to having our own historical data to inform next year’s plantings as well! I will say that I didn’t use the outcomes feature much because it took an extra step to fill that in but I do think it’s useful and will try to use it more next year.
* Throughout the growing season I struggled to input observations for our crops. Once you sent the survey reminder I finally got around to checking out the User Manual and figured it out from there. I wish I'd done a better job of keeping up with our garden on this app. Next year!
* I'm unable to figure out how to enter outcomes.
* After I enter an update, it seems like I can't scroll down to the "submit" button right away. It takes a few tries and then the screen moves. Maybe this is my phone's fault as it's now older.
* Maybe I missed this, but I'd like to be able to enter more than one observation for a crop.

#### Q4: What other features would you like to see incorporated?

* Companion planting information possibly? Or pest information and resources?
* I provided a lot of feedback via the chat group
* I know you can do this in observations, but it would be nice to have a better way to indicate that a planting failed. We had several pepper plants that sprouted but then stayed super stunted so we just scrapped them. Maybe some kind of indicator on the planting would be helpful so that when I look back I know immediately like “oh I didn’t harvest that plant early, it just totally failed.”
* I'm not sure how to best use this app to connect with other gardeners to ask questions, compare notes, etc. I need to go through the User Manual again....
* A warning when your text is reaching character limit. I always go over and then have to go back and be more concise. Also, initial caps on text. (I should probably let that go, but I always go back and correct it.)

#### Q5: Did using Geo Garden Club improve or change an aspect of your garden's outcomes or your gardening experience?

* I think it's reduced my frantic chaos planning that tents to happen and I can't wait to see how much it helps me organize and plan out garden tasts come spring
* not this year, just too busy to follow through unfortunately.
* I liked having an easy place to capture notes about plantings. In the past when I’ve used spreadsheets, I feel like I always took notes in my phone or on paper and never had all the information I needed in one place. We had a weird gardening season this year but I think this coming year having Geo Garden Club will be really helpful.
* Not yet, only because we didn't use it to the fullest extent. Next year!
* I'm paying more attention to outcomes and dates with this tool. I also look forward to learning from the choices that more successful gardeners made. This is my first year in this area and I'm realizing that I need to learn how to adapt to this cooler, shorter season.

#### Q6: What changes would make Geo Garden Club easier or more enjoyable to use?

* I think it being clearer what information needs to be filled out for adding plants maybe. But I just started using the feature of copying plants from other gardens and it's fantastic
less time-consuming
* I think it’s a great platform. I just need to retrain my brain to actually use it! I put all the plantings in but was bad about actually checking off the tasks. Normally I wouldn’t say this about an app, but in this case, I think push notifications on my phone would actually be super helpful! It would remind me to actually open the app and do some work in the garden haha.
* It's still a little cumbersome to enter varieties -- I have to leave my main garden and go back to an earlier screen to add one, as far as I can tell. I look forward to getting more comfy with using the app. I'll figure it out!
* Suggestions above. Thanks for letting me try it out. I think it's a great idea.

#### Q7: How much should we charge per month?

| Amount per month | Count |
|------------------|-------|
| $1 | 2     |
| $2 | 2     |
| $3 | 1     |


#### Q8: If there's anything else you'd like to tell, please do so below. Thank you so much for your comments!

* I haven't had the chance to use it too much, life got chaotic and my fall garden will probably be pretty lacking because of it. But I love what you've built so far
* I found that it was extremely time-consuming to the point where I really didn't follow through once the season got super demanding. I would try again next year and see how much easier/quicker it is having a year of entries/varieties/plantings already in the database. Getting everything in there was really a lot of work this first go around.
* Seriously so proud of you. This is such a cool resource and I look forward to starting my growing season next year knowing I’ve got this tool in my pocket. As I continue to use Geo Garden Club I’ll be sure to provide any additional feedback as it comes up. But for now, I love it and think it will only get better from here!
* We appreciate being able to partake in your beta testing. I'm sorry we didn't use it as much as we'd anticipated. We'll try harder next year! Good work with everything -- it's clear you and your team have spent countless hours making this app as awesome as it is!

## Analysis

The results indicate that all the innovative features are of interest to a majority of respondents. This is because there was no feature for which a majority responded "Don't use". On the other hand, very few features were "used a lot".  This is probably due to one or more of the following: (a) the small number of people in the chapter, (b) the lack of multiple seasons of data, or (c) the feature was hard to use. 

The results also indicate that the system is hard to use. Some respondents couldn't figure out how to use features, others found certain features to be too time-consuming to use.

Finally, the perceived value of the system was lower than we hoped, as most respondents would only want to pay $1-2 per month for the system. Hopefully we can improve the system so that people can use it more easily, and thus derive more value, and thus be willing to pay more for it.
