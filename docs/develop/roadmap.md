# Roadmap

This roadmap documents our plans for incremental development and release of our technology, with the goal of revenue starting in 2026. While this pace seems glacial, note that we are bootstrapping this technology ourselves without any external investment and with no paid staff. This approach gives us the benefit of being able to delay requiring users to pay for the technology until we have documentation that our technology provides proven benefits.
