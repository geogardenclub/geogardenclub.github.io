# Roadmap

This roadmap documents our plans for incremental development and release of our technology, with the goal of revenue starting in 2026. While this pace seems glacial, note that we are bootstrapping this technology ourselves without any external investment and with no paid staff. This approach gives us the benefit of being able to delay requiring users to pay for the technology until we have documentation that our technology provides proven benefits.

| 2025 | 2.0 (Public) release evaluation   | Gather evidence for GGC business viability through deployment and evaluation the 2.0 (public) release.

The 2.0 release will allow gardeners from any geographic region to sign up, but we do not intend to explicitly market the app anywhere outside of Whatcom County. By the end of 2025, the business viability of GGC will be evaluated based on the size of the Whatcom County chapter, and the presence and/or size of any other Chapters. |
