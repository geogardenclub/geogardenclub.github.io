# Scripts

GGC development is supported by a number of Unix shell scripts. All scripts are located in the top-level directory, are named starting with "run", and use snake case to separate words in the script name.  

| Name                         | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| run_build_runner.sh          | Invokes the builder running code generation facility, needed for entities using Freezed, JSON Serializable, and Riverpod.                                                                                                                                         |
| run_cloc.sh                  | Invokes [CLOC](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) to obtain the current size of the system.   Note you must have installed CLOC first.                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                       |
| run_deploy.sh                | Bumps version number, updates release notes, builds the .ipa and .apk files, and deploys the web version.                                                                                                                                                         |
| run_emulators.sh             | Starts up the Firebase emulators to support interactive development using test data.  See [Development using emulators](quality-assurance/testing.md#development-using-emulators) for details.                                                                    |
| run_flutter_clean.sh         | After upgrading Flutter or pub.dev packages, the build might fail either during the `pod install` or `xcode build` steps. When this happens, google searches based on the error message often provide bad advice for Flutter developers. Try this script instead. |
| run_flutter_downgrade.sh     | In the event that a new release breaks things and you have not followed the recommendation to install [FVM](installation.md#fvm), you can try using this script to back out to the previous release of flutter.                                                   |
| run_pub_add.sh               | If you are rebuilding the ggc_app with a fresh install of Flutter, this script installs all of the packages in one command. Before running it, make sure the list of packages is up to date!                                                                      |

| run_rebuild_podfile.sh       | If the build fails due to a podfile problem, this script rebuilds it appropriately.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| run_tests_emulator.sh        | Runs the entire integration test suite.   See [Running tests with the emulator](quality-assurance/testing.md#run_tests_emulatorsh) for details.                                                                                                                   |
| run_tests_single_emulator.sh | Runs a single integration test.   See [Running a single test with the emulator](quality-assurance/testing.md#run_tests_single_emulatorsh) for details.                                                                                                            |
| run_tool_versions.sh         | Prints out the names and versions of important tech stack components. Used to ensure that all developers are running the same tech stack. Also useful when trying to diagnose why the system builds and runs for one developer but produces errors for another.   |                                                 |
