# Privacy and security

:::warning rewrite

On the one hand, we want to preserve certain types of privacy:

* Users pick a unique "username" which is used in postings so that they do not have to reveal their true name.
* The application does not reveal (and does not know) the precise location of gardens, only their country and postal code.
* Users can tag an Observation as "private", and in that case it will not be visible to users outside of the garden's owner and editors.  This allows users to take photos regarding the garden for their personal data collection without feeling inhibited about it becoming "public". For example, the photo might reveal faces or locations.

On the other hand, we want to facilitate the creation of a community of practice. For this reason, all garden data (plantings, etc) are available, in at least a read-only format, to all members of a chapter.

A significant goal for the 1.0 release is to test the hypothesis that it is not problematic for users to share these kinds garden details with others in the chapter.

A broader question, that we will not explore in the 1.0 release, is what kinds of data could be made available across Chapters.
