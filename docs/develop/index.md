# Welcome to the GGC Developers Guide

Welcome to the Developer's Guide for the Geo Garden Club app.

Please note that the Developer's Guide consists of all pages in the `/develop` subdirectory of the GGC website.  The Developer's Guide is "partially hidden", in that these pages do not appear in the sidebar of the pages discoverable from the home page of the site, and the `robots.txt` file discourages crawlers from this set of pages. To access these pages, you need to know the URL (https://geogardenclub.com/docs/develop).  

That said, this hidden-ness is only partial because:

1. If you share the URL with others, then they can access these pages. There is no access control. 
2. The GitHub geogardenclub.github.io repository containing the sources for these pages is a public repository. (GGC,LLC is not yet rich enough to pay $4/seat/month for GitHub Teams.) Thus, anyone who cares to poke around in that repo can discover all of these pages. 

After some thought, I have concluded that the benefits of using Docusaurus for the GGC Developer Guide outweigh the risks involved with the possibility of architectural and design information "leaking" to competitors.  But, I am noting this issue up front so that everyone adding information to these pages should consider the impact of that information being exposed to outsiders at some future date.
