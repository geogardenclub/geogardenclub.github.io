# Welcome

Welcome to Geo Garden Club (GGC)!  

GGC is more than just a garden planning app; it's a community-building platform designed to enhance garden management while fostering local camaraderie. Our goal is to help you connect with fellow gardeners in your area to exchange plans, insights, and seeds. With practical planning tools and intuitive record-keeping features, we hope that GGC will empower you to learn from both triumphs and setbacks.   

Here are our most important guiding principles.

**Local insights matter.**
Upon registration, GGC assigns you to a local chapter based on your zip code, ensuring that you access relevant gardening data and observations. You can explore chapter-wide outcome data to discover local best practices and optimal planting times tailored to _your area._

**Gardens don't have to be solitary endeavors.**
GGC supports group gardening by enabling garden owners to grant "edit" access to fellow GGC chapter members. GGC helps you to connect with chapter members through notifications and shared observations, and engage in focused conversations via garden and chapter-based chat rooms.

**Historical garden data is valuable.**
GGC helps you record and analyze garden data over multiple seasons, helping you to remember and build upon your past experiences. Tools include a multi-year Timeline screen and Filtering timeline data by crop, bed, family, or variety.

**Gardening extends beyond a single season.**
GGC recognizes that gardens span multiple years and crops aren't restricted to summer alone. The multi-year Timeline Screen accommodates a diverse range of planting schedules. From winter crops to perennials and biennials, this feature empowers gardeners to plan for all types of crops throughout the year.

**Seed saving and sharing builds resiliency.**
Incorporating seed saving into planting timelines ensures accurate space allocation for each crop. GGC implements a seed database for each chapter, where gardeners can review outcomes and planting timelines to make informed decisions. You can connect with fellow gardeners offering seeds, fostering a culture of resilience and resource sharing.
