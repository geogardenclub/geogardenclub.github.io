# Mobile App Sneak Peek

We are working on the alpha release of the GeoGardenClub mobile app, with an expected release date of early 2024. While the app is not yet ready for prime time, we thought it would be fun to show you some selected screen shots so you can get an idea of where we're heading.


## Login

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/login.png"/>

As with all mobile apps, you will be asked to sign in and/or register when you download the app. 

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

## Home Screen

After logging in, you will come to your home screen. The home screen has a bottom navigation bar providing various views on your gardens:

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/home-tasks.png"/>

The Home Screen "Tasks" View provides a kind of "To Do" list. Most entries are automatically generated from your garden plan, although you can add Tasks manually if you wish.

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/home-gardens.png"/>

The Home Screen "Gardens" View provides a summary of all of the gardens that you own or have been given access to by the owner. 

You can click the "Details" button to get more information about a specific garden. (See below.)

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/home-observations.png"/>

The Home Screen "Observations" View provides a kind of "Instagram-ish" scrolling list of photos made by yourself and other gardeners in the Chapter. 

Observations allow gardeners to document interesting events in their garden, post questions to other gardeners in the chapter, or simply post beautiful pictures for all to enjoy.

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

## Garden Details Screen

When a "Details" button is available for a Garden Summary, you can click it to obtain additional information about that garden. 

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/details-timeline.png"/>

The Garden Details Screen "Timeline" View provides a perspective on the chronological ordering of plantings in your garden. 

You can zoom in to display the garden at 6 month or 1 month views. Each planting can be in one of four phases: in the greenhouse, growing in a bed, available for harvest, or being left to produce seeds.  Any of these phases are optional. 

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/details-filter.png"/>

The Garden Details Screen "Filter" View provides a perspective on your garden over multiple years. 

For example, this screenshot allows the gardener to review what varieties of cucumbers they have planted over the past four years, and the timings associated with each of them.
<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/details-outcomes.png"/>

The Garden Details Screen "Outcomes" View provides access to the Outcome data associated with the plantings in your garden.

This can help you experiment and refine the varieties you choose to plant and the way you plant them in order to optimize one or more outcome measures. 

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/details-tasks.png"/>

The Garden Details Screen "Tasks" View provides access to the tasks associated with this specific garden.

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

## Chapter Summary Screen

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/chapter-summary.png"/>

The Chapter Gardeners Screen provides a summary of the gardens, gardeners, and other information associated with the garden.

Every GeoGardenClub user is a member of a Chapter. Chapters are organized based on a small number of adjacent zip codes. 

By organizing users into chapters, we believe that it will be easier to share useful information with each other, and enable activities such as seed sharing that support food resilience. 

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>

## Chapter Gardeners Screen

<img style={{float: "left", marginLeft: "20px", marginRight: "20px"}} width="300" src="/img/sneak-peek/chapter-gardeners.png"/>

The Chapter Gardeners Screen provides a kind of "Directory" for the members of the chapter

For privacy purposes, users get to pick a unique "username" when they register, which is the only way they are identified to other gardeners in the Chapter. User can optionally provide a photo (which may or may not be a headshot).

<div style={{clear:"both"}}></div>


## there's more to come...

We hope you enjoyed this sneak peek of the GGC app. We want you to know that we plan on providing a variety of other interesting features in the alpha release, such as Badges, Seeds, and Themes.   Stay tuned!
