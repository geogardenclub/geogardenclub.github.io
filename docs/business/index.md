# Welcome to the GGC Business Development Guide

Welcome to the Business Development Guide for the Geo Garden Club project.

Please note that the Business Development Guide consists of all pages in the `/docs/business` subdirectory of the GGC website.  The Business Development Guide is "partially hidden", in that these pages do not appear in the sidebar of the pages discoverable from the home page of the site, and the `robots.txt` file discourages crawlers from retrieving this set of pages. So, in general, to access these pages, you need to be given the URL (https://geogardenclub.com/docs/business) by a member of the project.  

That said, this hidden-ness is only partial because:

1. If you share the URL with others, then they can access all of these pages. There is no access control. Please use restraint. 
2. The GitHub geogardenclub.github.io repository containing the sources for these pages is a public repository. (GGC,LLC is not yet rich enough to pay $4/seat/month for GitHub Teams.) Thus, anyone who cares to poke around in that repo can discover all of these pages. 

We currently believe that the benefits of using Docusaurus for the GGC Business Development Guide outweigh the risks involved with the possibility of this information "leaking" to competitors.  But, I am noting this issue up front so that everyone adding information to these pages should consider the impact of that information being exposed to outsiders at some future date.
