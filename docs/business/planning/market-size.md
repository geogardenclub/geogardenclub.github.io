# Market Size Estimation (USA)

Here is some data that can help provide a sense for the potential market size for GGC in the United States.

## How many home gardens are there in the US? 

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/716538/us-vegetable-gardening-participation/), 39 million US households did some form of vegetable gardening in 2020.  However, only a small fraction of these households would be interested in GGC.

## How many US gardeners might be interested in GGC? 

How many gardeners are sufficiently dedicated to gardening that they would be willing to play for a subscription to GGC if it met their needs? 

A 2022 Survey indicates that there are 79,000 master gardeners in the US (https://mastergardener.extension.org/impacts/). This is one population of gardeners who are sufficiently dedicated to the craft that they might consider paying for GGC.

Becoming a master gardener takes a lot of time and energy, so it is likely that there are many more gardeners who are not master gardeners but who are still sufficiently dedicated to gardening that they would be interested in GGC.  If we estimate that there are 10 additional dedicated gardeners per master gardener, then that indicates a market size of 750K gardeners in the US who would be interested in GGC.

## How many viable GGC chapters could there be in the US?

A GGC Chapter is "viable" when there are a sufficient number of local gardeners willing to pay for and add data to the app. 

One way to estimate the number of viable GGC chapters is to consider the number of master gardener chapters. A master gardener chapter exists only when there are a sufficient number of local gardeners who want to take advantage of those services. So, the total number of master gardener chapters could serve as an estimate for the total number of potentially viable GGC chapters. 

While I was not able to find data for all 50 states, here are some data points:

| State | Number of Master Gardener Chapters |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| WA    | 9                                  |
| OR    | 23                                 |
| CA    | 43                                 |
| HI    | 5                                  |
| NM    | 3                                  |
| AK    | 3                                  | 
| TX    | 54                                 |
| VA    | 12                                 |
| MI | 14                                 |
| WI | 50                                 |
| OH | 62                                 |
| OK | 27                                 |

For this sample of states, there is an average of 25 chapters per state, so it seems reasonable to estimate that there is the potential for between 500 and 1000 GGC chapters in the United States.
