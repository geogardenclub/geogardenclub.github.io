# GGC Customer Lifecycle

As noted previously, a fundamental strategic challenge for 2026 is to make progress in determining if GGC is a viable business. To do that, we think it's helpful to define a "GGC customer lifecyle", which provides us with a way to diagnose problems in obtaining and retaining paying customers and understand how to allocate business resources to resolve them and thus increase revenue. 

We define the GGC customer lifecycle as three sequential phases: customer acquisition, customer evaluation, and customer retention. The customer evaluation phase has two subphases: customer onboarding and customer exploration:

Customer acquisition ends when the customer downloads the app, and customer evaluation ends when the customer pays for the app for the first time. 

## Customer acquisition 

The first phase, customer acquisition, involves all the events and activities that eventually result in a person downloading the GGC app for the first time. From the business point of view, the customer acquisition phase is "marketing".

We can identify problems in the customer acquisition phase by: (a) measuring the number of times the app is downloaded in a given time period, and (b) measuring the cost and/or time of marketing activities intended to lead to downloads during that same time period.

## Customer evaluation

The second phase is "customer evaluation". This involves the activities following downloading up to the point where the user makes their first subscription payment.

There are two subphases to the customer evaluation phase: "customer onboarding" and "customer exploration".

In customer onboarding, users bring up the downloaded app, go through the registration process, fill out their profile page, and accept a subscription plan (which results in the Home screen being displayed for the first time). While this phase generally requires only a few minutes, we found in 2025 that there is a significant amount of attrition at multiple points during onboarding: some users download but never open the app, others open the app but never make it to the home screen. 

Those users who make it through customer onboarding enter the second subphase: "customer exploration". This involves learning (or not) about the GGC concepts of gardens, beds, plantings, tasks, outcomes, and so forth and how they may (or may not) improve one's gardening capabilities and outcomes.  Customer exploration generally lasts weeks or months, and ends when the user either unsubscribes from the app or makes a subscription plan payment for the first time. 

There are several measures we can use to gain insight into customer evaluation. The primary one is "number of first subscription payments / number downloads" for a given time period.  If that fraction is 1.0, it means that 100% of people downloading the app eventually paid money to us (the best case scenario). If it's zero, we lost everyone. If it's undefined, no one downloaded the app. ðŸ˜„

There are also helpful "secondary" measures for customer evaluation. For example, we can measure that number of percentage of users who downloaded the app who actually registered, then the number of users who registered and then made it to their home screen. These two measures provide insight into the effectiveness of the onboarding subphase. 

We can also measure things like the percentage of users who made it to the Home screen and then created a garden, or planting, or outcome, or observation, etc. These help us understand the effectiveness of the customer exploration subphase.  

Note that the "getting started" emails fit neatly into the customer evaluation phase.

## Customer retention

Finally, the "customer retention" phase focuses on the experience of users who are currently paying for the app. The primary measure of retention is the percentage of users who, having paid for the app at least once, have not cancelled their subscription.  

There are also secondary measures, which revolve around "satisfaction"----does the app continue to address their needs? What do we need to add or fix to keep them paying us money?

Now that we have a model of the customer lifecycle, the next page discusses how we should strategically allocate resources for 2026 across these phases in order to make the most progress towad understanding if GGC is a viable business.
