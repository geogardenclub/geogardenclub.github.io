# 2026 Benchmarks and Projections

The previous page listed potential business and development activities intended to increase the viability of the business in 2026.

In this page, we present "benchmark" data from 2025 along with "projections" for 2026. These projections represent our estimate of the impact of implementing an appropriate subset of these activities on the business. 

Note that we make conservative estimates for Q3 and Q4 of 2025 since that data is not yet available.  

## Customer Acquisition

The Customer Acquisition Phase corresponds to the marketing activities that result in new downloads of the app.

In 2025, we spent $4,324 in marketing to acquire 266 downloads. In 2026, we plan to almost double our investment in marketing with the hopes of a 400% increase in downloads with a significantly lower cost per download. We believe this is achievable if we can improve the social proof associated with GeoGardenClub and successfully partner with community organizations. 

## Customer Evaluation

The Customer Evaluation phase starts with the download of the app and ends with the first payment on a subscription plan.

:::info Calculating DL->1stPay is complicated
While the customer experience is a straightforward sequence from download to registration to subscription to first payment, note that due to the free trial offer, there is a six-month gap between accepting a subscription plan and first payment. This means that a user who subscribes at the end of Q2 will not make their first payment until Q4. This makes it difficult to calculate DL->1stPay within a single quarter for 2025. The "2025 Total" value (8%) is the most meaningful for DL->1stPay.
:::

The 2025 data reveals several "attrition points":
* Not everyone who downloads the app goes on to register.
* Not everyone who registers agrees to a subscription plan
* Not everyone who agrees to a subscription plan actually makes a first payment (i.e. they cancel prior to the completion of the free trial)



The combined impact of all of these attrition points is that, in 2025, only 8% of those who downloaded the app actually made a first payment on their subscription, for a net attrition rate of 92%. This is crazy high.

During late 2025, we began implementing a sequence of onboarding emails that are automatically sent to newly registered users approximately once a week. These emails incrementally introduce users to important features of the app. We believe that in 2026, the availability of onboarding emails will help reduce the attrition rate. 

In addition, we believe that increasing social proof, improving usability, and improving product-market-fit will also reduce attrition.

Our hope is that net impact of all of these improvements is to reduce the net attrition rate during Customer Evaluation from 92% to 72%. 


## Customer Retention

The Customer Retention phase represents the behavior of customers after they have made their first payment. More specifically, we need to track how many customers cancel their subscription after having made their first payment.  

At the time of writing, we do not have useful data regarding the retention phase for 2025, since the first payments only happened in the past month or two.

The following table represents our estimates for the net number of paying customers each quarter, given an estimated 10% cancellation rate of our total paying customers each quarter. 

<iframe style={{width: '100%', height: '200px', paddingBottom: '20px'}} src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRHfJre8e7SkCNW3b2DhVLf57D95neAnUFuMgh_GzX9_6er4eEM5ORPidDGx3SxJcIGIkNwhcLQ3Che/pubhtml?gid=676886051&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

This table shows that we entered 2026 with 20 paying customers. The "New" column represents the number of new paying customers by the end of each quarter, which is derived from the "1st Pay" column in the Customer Evaluation spreadsheet. We add the current and new customers together and take 10% to estimate the number of cancellations. Current + New - Cancelled results in the "Net" number of paying customers at the end of each quarter.

As a result, we estimate that by the end of 2026, will have 259 paying customers. 

## Profit and Loss

We can calculate profit and loss as the (actual or estimated) revenue from paying customers minus the (actual or estimated) expenses incurred for each quarter.

<iframe style={{width: '100%', height: '350px', paddingBottom: '20px'}} src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRHfJre8e7SkCNW3b2DhVLf57D95neAnUFuMgh_GzX9_6er4eEM5ORPidDGx3SxJcIGIkNwhcLQ3Che/pubhtml?gid=145188525&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

Revenue is calculated as the (estimated or actual) number of paying customers at the end of the quarter times $4.00 estimated payment per month times three months.

Expenses are calculated as the (estimated or actual) market expenses for the quarter.

## Discussion

These calculations reveal that if the corresponding assumptions hold, GeoGardenClub will show a very small profit of $3,106 in 2026. This, of course, falls far short of the revenue required for GeoGardenClub to be a viable business. 

Some questions for discussion:

* Do our assumptions appear reasonable? 
* Are there changes we can make to the strategic plan that might significantly improve 2026 net income? In other words, what can we do to significantly improve customer acquisition (i.e. downloads), and/or significantly improve customer evaluation (i.e. percentage of downloads to 1st payment)? (It seems unlikely that decreasing marketing costs or increasing customer retention rates will significantly improve 2026 net income.)
* Is it reasonable for us to only make $3,106 in our second year of business, given our small amount of human and financial resources? Or should we consider this a huge warning sign?
