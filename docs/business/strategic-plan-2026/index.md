# Executive Summary

This document is intended to facilitate a discussion that results in a prioritized list of business and development activities to prepare for the 2026 North American gardening season, which will start in January when many gardeners begin to think about planning their gardens.

During 2025, we had several significant business successes, including public release of the app, acquisition of approximately 100 users, and a small amount of revenue from a handful of paying customers.  

However, 2025 did not provide evidence that GGC is a viable business. Some of this may be due to marketing, some of this may be due to app immaturity and lack of product-market fit. 

An analysis of the current app indicates opportunities for improvement in usability, as well as a set of potential features present in other gardening apps but missing from GGC.

A competitive analysis indicates that our pricing model is competitive, and that we must find a way to effectively market our unique features

Finally, we propose a set of activities in preparation for 2026 to improve customer acquisition, retention, and satisfaction.
