# 2025 Successes and Failures 

To begin, let's summarize the successes and failures of GeoGardenClub during 2025.

Our successes include:

* We have successfully developed a production quality mobile application that appears to provide usable support for home garden planning and management, along with a variety of unique features which appears to make it "best in class" for gardeners with certain technology requirements.
* In early 2025, GGC had tables at seed swaps which seemed very effective at generating interest and new downloads.
* We currently have a couple dozen active users of the app, and around a dozen users are now actively paying for monthly (or annual) subscriptions.
* The technology and code base seem sound, and we have not encountered significant technical problems around fixing bugs or implementing new features. 
* We have built a suite of communication and outreach channels, including: (a) regular Instagram and Facebook postings, (b) a monthly email newsletter, (c) a series of onboarding emails to step new users through the most important features, and (d) a comprehensive online user guide.
* Our monthly burn rate is practically non-existent, due to very low technology costs and zero employee payroll costs.

That said, the fundamental failure of 2025 is that we did not determine if GeoGardenClub is a viable/profitable business. Put another way: 2025 did not show that GGC can obtain a consistent revenue stream that significantly exceeds the costs of (a) compensating employees at market rates (b) marketing and (c) infrastructure.  We estimate that the revenue stream required to demonstrate that GGC is a viable business is between 5K and 10K paying customers per month (i.e. $250K to $500K gross annual revenue).

Some significant "warning signs" from 2025 that GGC might not be a viable business include:

* Lack of success with initial online marketing attempts. (Instagram, Facebook, Apple, and Google ads failed to attract significant numbers of new customers.)
* Lack of organic growth. (i.e. existing users successfully getting their friends to use the system)
* Lack of "social proof". (only 5 App Store reviews, no endorsements or awards by gardening influencers or publications)
* Lack of users. (Only a handful of active users (and revenue-producing) subscriptions as of August, 2025).
