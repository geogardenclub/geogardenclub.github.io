# 2025 Successes and Failures 

To begin, let's summarize the successes and failures of GeoGardenClub during 2025.

Our successes include:

* We successfully developed a production quality mobile application that provides usable support for home garden planning and management, along with a variety of unique features which make it "best in class" for gardeners with certain technology requirements.
* In early 2025, GGC participated in several in-person events which were effective at generating interest and new downloads.
* To date, the app has been downloaded over 150 times. As of late summer, we have a couple dozen active users, and around a dozen users are paying for monthly (or annual) subscriptions.
* The technology and code base seem sound, and we have not encountered significant technical problems around fixing bugs or implementing new features. 
* We built a suite of communication and outreach channels, including: (a) regular Instagram and Facebook postings, (b) a monthly email newsletter, (c) a series of onboarding emails to step new users through the most important features, and (d) a comprehensive online user guide.
* Our monthly burn rate is practically non-existent, due to very low technology costs and zero employee payroll costs.

That said, the fundamental failure of 2025 is that we did not determine if GeoGardenClub is a viable/profitable business.

Put another way: 2025 did not show that GGC can obtain a consistent revenue stream that significantly exceeds the costs of (a) paid employees (b) marketing and (c) infrastructure.  We estimate that the revenue stream required to demonstrate that GGC is a viable business is between 5K and 10K paying customers per month (i.e. $250K to $500K gross annual revenue).

Some significant "warning signs" from 2025 that GGC might not be a viable business include:

* Lack of success with initial online marketing attempts. (Instagram, Facebook, Apple, and Google ads failed to attract significant numbers of new customers.)
* Lack of organic growth. (i.e. existing users successfully getting their friends to use the system)
* Lack of "social proof". (only 5 App Store reviews, no endorsements or awards by gardening influencers or publications)
* Lack of users. (Only a handful of active users (and revenue-producing) subscriptions as of August, 2025).

Despite these warning signs, we remain optimistic that with appropriate improvements to our technology and marketing, we stand a good chance of growing GeoGardenClub into a viable business. The remainder of this strategic planning document is intended to help us figure out how to steer the business in that direction.
