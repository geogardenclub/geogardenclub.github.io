# 2026 Activities

This page presents our thinking regarding ways to allocate time and money across the four GGC customer lifecycle phases in 2026.

:::info
It was determined that customer retention is the primary focus of 2026 activities.  All proposed tasks should point towards this ultimate goal.  Additional activities that don't target customer retention are included at the bottom of the page for future consideration.
:::

## Customer Acquisition Phase

In 2026, we need to improve our ability to find new target customers and get them to download the system. Acquisition activities will focus on customers in our target demographic who are most likely to continue using the app beyond the free trial period.

*Improve online marketing.*  In 2025, we eventually stopped paying for online ads because it was not translating into new downloads. We hypothesize that this was because of a lack of social proof. In 2026, we will resume experimenting with online advertising through an ambassador program which will generate content while increasing social proof.

*Implement an "ambassador" program.* Coursicle has [ambassador](https://www.coursicle.com/blog/coursicle-ambassador/) and [affiliate](https://www.coursicle.com/blog/coursicle-affiliate/) programs whose goal is to "bring in as many new users to Coursicle as possible." Both programs involve compensated creation of short-form content for Instagram or TikTok. Compensation varies according to the program (for ambassadors, basically $10/video, for affiliates, basically 1$/download).  We will develop an ambassador program to enhance online advertising.

*Improve offline marketing.* In 2025, appearances at events such as seed swaps seemed to create interest from attendees in GGC. In 2026, we will continue to table at seed swaps because of the high percentage of attendees that are our target audience.

*Implement an intern program.* In conjunction with WWU, we could develop an internship program in which students help market GeoGardenClub for course credit. These students could participate in both offline marketing and online ambassador activities.

*Implement a referral program.* A correctly designed and implemented referral program could accelerate the growth of a chapter and thus support the creation of a useful gardening community.  It also provides "social proof" in the form of the referring customer.  

## Customer Evaluation Phase

In 2026, we need to improve the percentage of customers who, having downloaded the app, successfully make it through the onboarding and exploration phases and ultimately pay for the app for the first time. This requires evolving new users into experienced users who obtain value from the app. In 2026, we will:

*Implement "high-touch" support during evaluation.* In addition to the Getting Started emails, we could consider sending personalized emails to customers during the evaluation phase to ensure that they are not encountering roadblocks, and using secondary measures to make these emails more effective. For example, we might send an email saying something like: "We notice you haven't created a garden yet. Can we help you learn how to do that? Is there a reason you've delayed?"

*Add user-focused home screen view.* The current Home screen has views for Gardens, Observations, Tasks, Chat, and Share. We can add a view for the User that provides information about their accomplishments (badges), and indications of what they haven't experienced yet in the app, and aggregated chapter information about planned garden tasks.

*Add app feature badges.* Current badges all revolve around gardening-related accomplishments. We can introduce another set of badges that are awarded based on evidence that the user has used app features. For example, a badge that is awarded when the user has created their first planting. This can both provide a sense of accomplishment and enable the system to guide the user to use the system (by indicating the remaining set of App Feature badges to earn) 

*Add confetti.*  Providing some sort of animation when the user accomplishes some sort of task for the first time can provide a "dopamine hit" that makes the app more fun to use. 

*Provide a simplified create garden screen.*  We can streamline the evaluation phase a bit by inserting a simplified Create Garden form into the onboarding sequence. That way, when the user hits their Home screen, they already have a Garden.

*Add challenges.* Gardening challenges can encourage app use and community connections. For example, a challenge to get all gardeners paying attention to and posting observations about a single crop. Or contests like biggest pumpkin for Halloween, most beautiful squash for Thanksgiving, etc. (Note: A challenge could be implemented as a specific type of forum post.)

*Automate completion of planting dates.* It would be helpful to auto-complete planting dates based on user or chapter data from prior seasons. In other words, after the user enters the start date, the pull date (and other dates) could be calculated and entered automatically.

## Customer Retention Phase

In general, paying customers have enough experience with the app to derive value from it.  To retain them, we need ways to be made aware when the app is not meeting their needs and respond appropriately.  For example, we could implement:

*Add forums*. A "forum" feature that enables discussion on user-generated topics. This will make it easier for users to bring up issues with the app. (Note: a feature request could be implemented as a specific type of forum post.)

*Add in-app review mechanisms.* For example, a mechanism to periodically ask users for feedback about specific features at the time they are using them. 

*Add personalized reach-out.* For example, an email that indicates that they are one of our most senior customers and a request for feedback.

## Customer Churn Phase

Due to lack of experience with customer churn, we are not proposing any activities regarding this phase of the customer lifecycle for 2026.

## Future activities

### Customer Acquisition

*Develop partnerships with community organizations.* These organizations might include Master Gardener associations, school garden programs, and/or food non-profits. Note that developing a viable partnership with an organization might require enhancing the GGC app with new features.

*Improve GGC's social proof.* Social proof is a psychological phenomenon where people look to the actions and behaviors of others to guide their own decisions, especially in situations of uncertainty. Increasing GGC's social proof could increase the "conversion rate": the percentage of people who, having learned about GGC through an online ad or other channel, go ahead and download the app and try it out. Some ways to increase GGC's social proof include:
* Reviews in the App and Play Stores.
* Articles about GGC in gardening publications.
* Grants and/or awards.
* Endorsements from community organizations (following a successful partnership).
* Endorsements from gardening influencers on Instagram and/or TikTok

*Improve offline marketing.* In 2025, appearances at events such as seed swaps seemed to create interest from attendees in GGC. Future offline marketing activities include:
* Tables at farmers markets
* Tables at Home and Garden Expos

### Customer Evaluation

*Add recurrent, user defined tasks.*  This can support watering reminders, etc.

*Add selected competitor's features.* Implement one or more of the [features present in other gardening apps](usability-2025#potential-features).

*Implement "like" and "favorite" UI elements.*  It is possible that providing these social media features could improve engagement.

### Customer Retention Phase

*Add wizard status.* Some mechanism to award active users with some sort of status that would encourage them to let us know if they see ways to improve the app. The goal of this status is to create a feeling of ownership over the app's direction with our top users.
