# Proposals for 2026

This page presents our thinking regarding the best ways to allocate time and money across the GGC customer lifecycle phases.

:::warning
This page currently presents a large list of activities to potentially work on for 2026.  It is intended to stimulate discussion.  We need to eventually decide upon a smaller set of tasks to actually focus on for 2026.
:::

## Customer Acquisition Phase

In 2026, we need to improve our ability to find new customers and get them to download the system. Some possible activities include:

*Partnerships with community organizations.* These organizations might include Master Gardener associations, school garden programs, and/or food non-profits. Note that developing a viable partnership with an organization might require enhancing the GGC app with new features.

*Improving GGC's social proof.* Social proof is a psychological phenomenon where people look to the actions and behaviors of others to guide their own decisions, especially in situations of uncertainty. It can be created from positive reviews, endorsements from experts or celebrities, high follower counts, or certifications. In 2026, we can solicit reviews, awards, or endorsements to improve the social proof of GGC.

*Improving online advertising strategies.*  In 2025, we eventually stopped paying for online marketing because it was not translating into new downloads. We hypothesize that this was because of a lack of social proof. In 2026, we can consider experimenting with online advertising if we make progress to improve social proof.

*Improving in-person events.* In 2025, in-person events appeared to be a successful marketing strategy. In 2026, we could continue (and expand) this marketing channel. (Note that Jenna will be unavailable to do this in Spring 2026; we will need to acquire an intern or some other person to take on this work.)

## Customer Evaluation Phase

In 2026, we need to improve the percentage of customers who, having downloaded the app, successfully make it through the onboarding and exploration phases and ultimately pay for the app for the first time. This requires evolving new users into experienced users who obtain value from the app. Possible helpful changes include:

*Implementing "high-touch" support during evaluation.* In addition to the Getting Started emails, we could consider sending personalized emails to customers during the evaluation phase to ensure that they are not encountering roadblocks, and using secondary measures to make these emails more effective. For example, we might send an email saying something like: "We notice you haven't created a garden yet. Can we help you learn how to do that? Is there a reason you've delayed?"

*User-focused home screen view.* The current Home screen has views for Gardens, Observations, Tasks, Chat, and Share. We can add a view for the User that provides information about their accomplishments (badges), and indications of what they haven't experienced yet in the app.

*App Feature Badges.* Current badges all revolve around gardening-related accomplishments. We can introduce another set of badges that are awarded based on evidence that the user has used app features. For example, a badge that is awarded when the user has created their first planting. This can both provide a sense of accomplishment and enable the system to guide the user to use the system (by indicating the remaining set of App Feature badges to earn) 

*Confetti.*  Providing some sort of animation when the user accomplishes some sort of task for the first time can provide a "dopamine hit" that makes the app more fun to use. 

*Create first garden screen.*  We can streamline the evaluation phase a bit by inserting a simplified Create Garden form into the onboarding sequence. That way, when the user hits their Home screen, they already have a Garden.

*Challenges.* Gardening challenges can encourage app use and community connections. For example, a challenge to get all gardeners paying attention to and posting observations about a single crop. Or contests like biggest pumpkin for Halloween, most beautiful squash for Thanksgiving, etc. (Note: A challenge could be implemented as a specific type of forum post.)

*Recurrent, user defined tasks.*  This can support watering reminders, etc.

*Automated completion of planting dates.* It would be very helpful to auto-complete planting dates based on user or chapter data from prior seasons. In other words, after the user enters the start date, the pull date (and other dates) could be calculated and entered automatically.

*Addition of competitor's features.* Implement one or more of the [features present in other gardening apps](usability-2025#potential-features).

## Customer Retention Phase

In general, paying customers have enough experience with the app to derive value from it.  To retain them, we need ways to be made aware when the app is not meeting their needs and respond appropriately.  For example, we could implement:

*Forums*. A "forum" feature that enables discussion on user-generated topics. This will make it easier for users to bring up issues with the app. (Note: a feature request could be implemented as a specific type of forum post.)

*In-app review mechanisms.* For example, a mechanism to periodically ask users for feedback about specific features at the time they are using them. 

*Personalized reach-out.* For example, an email that indicates that they are one of our most senior customers and a request for feedback.

*Wizard status.* Some mechanism to award active users with some sort of status that would encourage them to let us know if they see ways to improve the app. The goal of this status is to create a feeling of ownership over the app's direction with our top users.
