# Proposals for 2026

Here are some initial proposals for improving customer acquisition, retention, and satisfaction in 2026:  

## Customer Acquisition

In 2026, we need to improve our ability to find new customers (marketing). Some possible activities include:

New partnerships with community organizations. These organizations might include Master Gardener associations, school garden programs, and/or food non-profits. Note that developing a viable partnership with an organization might require enhancing the GGC app with new features.

Improved social proof. This could involve articles, podcasts, radio, or blogs in gardening, tech-for-good, or food resilience outlets, or awards, or increased numbers of reviews.

Improved online advertising strategies.  By "improved", I mean strategies that actually yield new customers.

Improved in-person events. In 2025, in-person events appeared to be a successful marketing strategy. In 2026, we could continue (and expand) this marketing channel. (Note that Jenna will be unavailable to do this in Spring 2026; we will need to acquire an intern or some other person to take on this work.)

## Customer Retention

In 2026, we need to improve customer retention as indicated by the percentage of users who actively use the app after downloading. Some possible activities include:

Enhanced monitoring of new users to detect new users who have not made it through onboarding and/or initial garden creation and then follow up with personalized emails offering support and guidance.

## Customer Satisfaction

In 2026, to improve customer satisfaction, we can improve "product-market fit" through app enhancements. Ideally, such enhancements will both increase the satisfaction of existing customers, as well as expand our market (i.e. increase the number of gardeners who find our app to be useful).

Some possible enhancements include:

A "forum" feature that enables discussion on user-generated topics.

Seasonal gardening challenges to encourage app use and community connections. For example, observation based: get all gardeners paying attention to and posting observations about a single crop etc. Or: chapter competitions, and a leaderboard to create friendly competition and chapter pride. Contests like biggest pumpkin for Halloween, most beautiful squash for Thanksgiving, etc.

An enhanced home page that provides information about badges, things to work on, etc.

Improving customer satisfaction also requires improving our ability to obtain feedback from users about what works and what doesn't. Some possible enhancements to support this include:
In-app review mechanisms that periodically ask users for feedback.
Direct, personal reach-out to a cross-section of gardeners each month to request feedback.

One or more of the [features present in other gardening apps](usability-2025#potential-features).
