# Proposals for 2026

This page presents our thinking regarding the best ways to allocate time and money across the GGC customer lifecycle phases.

## Customer Acquisition Phase

In 2026, we need to improve our ability to find new customers (marketing). Some possible activities include:

*New partnerships with community organizations.* These organizations might include Master Gardener associations, school garden programs, and/or food non-profits. Note that developing a viable partnership with an organization might require enhancing the GGC app with new features.

*Improving GGC's social proof.* Social proof is a psychological phenomenon where people look to the actions and behaviors of others to guide their own decisions, especially in situations of uncertainty. In marketing, it's used to build trust and credibility by showcasing evidence of popularity, such as positive reviews, endorsements from experts or celebrities, high follower counts, or certifications. This psychological principle helps influence consumer behavior, leading to increased sales, credibility, and customer engagement. 

*Improving online advertising strategies.*  In 2025, we eventually stopped paying for online marketing because it was not translating into new downloads. In 2026, we should consider experimenting with online advertising again. (Note that this activity might require improving our social proof first.)

*Improving in-person events.* In 2025, in-person events appeared to be a successful marketing strategy. In 2026, we could continue (and expand) this marketing channel. (Note that Jenna will be unavailable to do this in Spring 2026; we will need to acquire an intern or some other person to take on this work.)

## Customer Evaluation Phase

In 2026, we need to find ways to ensure that customers who downloaded the app successfully make it through the onboarding and exploration phases and ultimately pay for the app for the first time. This could include:

*Implementing "high-touch" support during evaluation.* In addition to the Getting Started emails, we could consider sending personalized emails to customers during the evaluation phase to ensure that they are not encountering roadblocks, and using secondary measures to make these emails more effective. For example, we might send an email saying something like: "We notice you haven't created a garden yet. Can we help you learn how to do that? Is there a reason you've delayed?"

## Customer Retention Phase

We will enter 2026 with paying users. What should we do to ensure the continued support of users?  Some possible ways to improve the customer experience include:

*Forums*. A "forum" feature that enables discussion on user-generated topics.

*Seasonal gardening challenges to encourage app use and community connections.* For example, observation based: get all gardeners paying attention to and posting observations about a single crop etc. Or: chapter competitions, and a leaderboard to create friendly competition and chapter pride. Contests like biggest pumpkin for Halloween, most beautiful squash for Thanksgiving, etc.

*An enhanced home page*. This would provide user-focused information about badges, things to work on, etc.

*Improved ability to obtain feedback.* Some possible enhancements to support this include:
* In-app review mechanisms that periodically ask users for feedback.
* Direct, personal reach-out to a cross-section of gardeners each month to request feedback.

*Addition of competitor's features.* Implement one or more of the [features present in other gardening apps](usability-2025#potential-features).
