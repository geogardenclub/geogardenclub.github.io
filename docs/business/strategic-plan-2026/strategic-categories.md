# Strategic Planning Categories

As noted previously, a fundamental strategic challenge for 2026 is to make progress in determining if GGC is a viable business. One customer-focused way of structuring our strategic planning is along the three areas covered in our monthly business reports: Customer acquisition, retention, and planning:

Customer Acquisition. This involves the following activities: (1) marketing activities by GGC to attract new customers, as well as (2) activities by new customers related to their initial "onboarding" (from downloading to subscription terms acceptance to initial garden creation). We measure customer acquisition by the number of new active users per month.

Customer Retention. We will retain customers if they find that GGC provides value consistent with the cost of their subscription. An important indicator for customer retention is customer activity within the app (customers that do not use the app almost certainly will not find it to provide value consistent with the cost of their subscription. On the other hand, heavy use of the app does not guarantee appropriate value.) We measure customer retention by the number of cancellations per month.

Customer Satisfaction. Evaluating customer satisfaction involves determining which features customers find valuable, which features customers dislike, and which features customers wish the product had but are currently missing.  We measure customer satisfaction by new review ratings and/or by internal satisfaction questionnaires and surveys.

In the best of all possible worlds, GGC would enjoy (1) a robust marketing strategy that results in 100+ customer acquisitions per month, combined with (2) a robust customer satisfaction strategy that results in high quality data regarding good, bad, and missing features. If we had (1) and (2), then it would be easier to make evidence-based decisions on how to grow the business. Since we lack both (1) and (2),  we are left with making educated guesses as to how to proceed in 2026.  That's a bit disconcerting, but perhaps not uncommon for a startup.
