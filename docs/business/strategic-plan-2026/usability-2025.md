# 2025 App Usability

To gain insight into how the current design of the app might contribute to 2025's problematic business results, I used an AI agent ([Ona](https://ona.com)) to read the GGC user guide and critique the design.  Here is a summary of its findings:

## Usability Concerns

Ona identified these concerns:

Complexity for New Users:
* Steep Learning Curve: The app requires understanding of Gardens → Beds → Plantings → Tasks → Observations → Outcomes hierarchy
* Complex Forms: Creating a planting requires multiple screens with numerous optional fields
* Cognitive Overhead: 30+ features accessible through complex navigation patterns
* No Progressive Disclosure: All functionality exposed at once rather than gradually introducing features

Mobile Design Issues:
* Form-Heavy Interface: Extensive forms don't translate well to mobile gardening use cases
* Complex Navigation: Multiple tabs, drawers, and nested screens make quick data entry difficult

Geographic Limitations:
* Chapter Dependency: Users must wait for local chapter to be viable (few dozen members)
* Limited Utility for Isolated Users: Single gardeners get minimal value from community features
* No Global Knowledge Base: Can't learn from successful gardeners in similar climates worldwide

## Potential Features

Ona lists the following features as present in other garden planning apps that are not currently in GeoGardenClub:

Garden Planning Tools:
* Visual Garden Designer: Competitors offer drag-and-drop bed layouts and plant spacing
* Companion Planting Guidance: Missing automated suggestions for beneficial plant combinations
* Succession Planting Automation: Requires manual planning of staggered plantings
* Square Foot Gardening Support: Popular method not specifically supported

Smart Automation & AI:
* Weather Integration: Missing frost warnings, watering reminders based on weather
* Plant Identification: Competitors offer AI-powered pest/disease/plant identification
* Personalized Recommendations: No AI suggestions based on location, experience, preferences
* Smart Notifications: Generic task reminders vs. intelligent, context-aware alerts

Garden Management Tools:
* Watering Tracking: Critical for garden success, especially for beginners
* Fertilizer/Amendment Tracking: Important for soil health and plant nutrition
* Pest/Disease Management: Limited to observations, no treatment tracking or recommendations
* Seed Starting Calculator: Missing timing calculations for indoor seed starting

Social & Community Tools:
* Expert Q&A: Unlike competitors with master gardener networks
* Enhanced Social Features: Basic chat vs. rich community features (forums, groups, events)
* Marketplace Integration: Sharing feature is primitive compared to integrated marketplaces 
* Local Events: Missing garden tours, workshops, seed swaps

Data & Analytics:
* Yield Optimization: Retail value calculation is experimental and admin-dependent
* Predictive Analytics: Can't predict optimal planting times or varieties
* Comparative Analysis: Limited ability to compare performance across similar gardens
* Export Capabilities: Data lock-in with no export options mentioned

## Discussion

Our team is too small and time is too tight to implement all of these improvements and enhancements for 2026. And given that a critique of the app is "cognitive overhead" from the existing 30+ features, adding more features indiscriminately might decrease the usability further. 

The strategic planning challenge is to carefully pick which of these recommendations (if any) to pursue for 2026.
