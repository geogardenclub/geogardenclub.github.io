# Instrumentation

## Overview 

The GeoGardenClub app implements an "instrumentation" system that is intended to support the business through visibility into usage of the system and user behaviors. 

The instrumentation system is build upon an Event document that is generated whenever a user performs a behavior within the system. These documents are stored within a Firebase collection.  To guide business decision-making, there are a set of admin commands that present data about system and user behaviors in various ways.

The instrumentation system will be used in conjunction with other sources of information (such as counts of downloads from the various stores, and subscription revenue) to produce monthly reports that help us to discover areas for improvement and guide investment of time and money in the business. 

## Event Types

Each event has a "type" which identifies the behavior the user was engaged in at the time the event was generated. Each event type has a "label", which is a shorthand for the event type to facilitate the display of tables in the system.  

Most labels are constructed from an initial lower case letter indicating an "action", followed by two upper case labels indicating and "entity".  

The action letters and their meanings are: "c" (create), "u" (update), "d" (delete), "v" (visit), and "2" (copy).

The entity letters and their meanings are: "PR" (User Profile), "HM" (Home Screen), "GD" (Garden), "PL" (Planting), "OB" (Observtion), "BD" (Bed), "TK" (Task), "CR" (Crop), and "VR" (Variety). 

Here's how they go together:

| Event Type | Label |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Create Profile | cPR |
| Create Garden | cGD |
| Create Observation | cOB |
| Create Task | cTK |
| Create Variety | cVR |
| Create Crop | cCP |
| Update Profile | uPR |
| Update Garden | uGD |
| Update Observation | uOB |
| Update Task | uTK |
| Update Variety | uVR |
| Update Crop | uCP |
| Delete Profile | dPR |
| Delete Garden | dGD |
| Delete Observation | dOB |
| Delete Task | dTK |
| Delete Variety | dVR |
| Delete Crop | dCP |
| Visit Home Screen | vHM |

## Event Table

The Event Table admin command provides a perspective on how the system was used in general, as well as how specific users used the system, for a specific time interval. 

### Default display

To invoke the Event Table command, go to Admin > Instrumentation > Event Table.  Here's an example:

<img src="/img/instrumentation/event-table-initial.png"/>

Because these tables are somewhat large, these screen shots show them using the web deployment of the GGC app. While you can use these commands on your phone, you have to scroll quite a lot. 

The default display presents data from March 1, 2025 (when Event data first began to be collected) to the current date. You can change the range of dates for which Events are displayed using the Event Table Date Range controller.  

The User column displays userIDs minus their hostname.  The default table is sorted by ascending userID.

The second column is labeled "#EV".  This column provides the total number of events generated by each user for the given date range. 

The remaining columns present event types using their label representation. The table only shows event types for which at least one event was generated in the time interval.  So, for example, since no user deleted a Garden in that date range, there is no "dGD" column. 

### Specifying a date range

The first thing you might want to modify from the default is the date range. For example, perhaps you want to analyze user behaviors for just the first two weeks of March 2025.  To do that, simply tap on the Event Table Date Range controller and select this range. Here's what might result:

<img src="/img/instrumentation/event-table-first-two-weeks.png"/>

Note that the User column has changed to reflect only those users who generated events during that interval, and the event types have changed as well. 

### Finding the most (or least) active users

It is often useful to see who was active (or not) during a given time interval. Click on the "#EV" column header to sort the table in ascending or descending order, which provides a sense for the relative activity level of each user. For example:

<img src="/img/instrumentation/event-table-most-active-users.png"/>

Note that the Event Table command filters out certain admin and developer accounts automatically so that these tables display data from "customers". Currently, the following userIDs are filtered out: geogardenclub@gmail.com, jennacorindeane@gmail.com, and johnson@hawaii.edu.

### Assessing new user behavior

An "cPR" event is generated when a user visits the Create Profile page, which happens when a new user has registered and signed in to the system. Once this new user has successfully created their profile, they will go to their Home Screen, which will generate a "vHM" event.  Once at their home screen, if the user is following our guidance, they will create a Garden, which will generate a "cGD" event.

Sorting by the cPR column is very useful, because it shows the users who have visited the Create Profile page and then whether they got to their Home Screen and finally created a Garden:

<img src="/img/instrumentation/event-table-create-profile.png"/>

This Event Table shows that during the given time interval:

* 8 users got to the Create Profile screen, indicating that they successfully registered and successfully signed in.
* 4 of those users successfully created their Profile, and made it to their Home screen.
* 1 of those users successfully created their Profile, made it to their Home screen, and created a Garden.

### Seeing the User Journey

The Event Table doesn't provide any information about the order or timing of user behaviors within the given date range.  This is limiting. For example, if a user has only recently joined GeoGardenClub, it might be fine that they have not yet created a Garden. 

To understand the behavior of a specific user, you can tap on any cell in the User column.  This takes you to the User Journey screen, which shows you the specific events in chronological order associated with that user. For example:

<img src="/img/instrumentation/user-journey-28-foibles.png"/>

At the time of writing, this User Journey shows that this user only recently joined GeoGardenClub, so it may be OK that they have not progressed beyond Create Profile.

Here's another example of the User Journey screen, this time for an active user:

<img src="/img/instrumentation/user-journey-diannnalee.png"/>

You can click the back arrow to return to the Event Table.

### Analyzing event types

You can click on other Event Type columns to sort the table and thus get more insight into the use of the system during the given time interval. For example, let's find out more about Observations by clicking on the "cOB" column header:


<img src="/img/instrumentation/event-table-observation-creators.png"/>

This reveals that six users were responsible for generating 17 Observations during this time interval. 

### Assessing global behavior

Another potentially useful analysis comes from looking at the second row of the table, which shows the total number of events of each type:

<img src="/img/instrumentation/event-table-headers.png"/>

I suspect this will become more useful when we can chart this over time. For example, it would be interesting to see how these numbers change on a month-to-month basis over the course of a year.  We might expect a larger number of Create Garden events early in the season. 

It will also be interesting to chart this data on a year-over-year basis.  Do we have more Create Profile events during March 2026 than we did in March 2025?
