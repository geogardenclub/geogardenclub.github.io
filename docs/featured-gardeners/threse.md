**Chapter:** Calaveras-CA

**How long have you been gardening?**

I am a new gardener! I live in the Sierra Nevada Mountains at an elevation of 4,800 feet. In the winter we can get up to 6 feet of snow. I  have grown flowers in barrels over the years, but have never attempted growing vegetables.  We have such a short growing season here and not a lot of sun because we are surrounded by very big trees. This year I decided why not try to grow vegetables in my barrels along with flowers and I can use the GeoGardenClub app as a helpful tool!

**What are your “must-grow” crops?**

Tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes! Lucious Tomatoes! I planted 2 varieties of cherry tomatoes and 2 varieties of big tomatoes.

Herbs. It’s so wonderful to be ale to walk outside and pick fresh herbs for your meal that your cooking.

Cucumbers. I have to admit that I think of my 4 year old grandson when I eat cucumbers. My daughter-in-law’s garden is amazing and my grandson loves a bowl of fresh sliced cucumbers straight from the garden. Every time I look at my cucumber plants I think of him and I get a big smile.

Flowers. Lupine is my favorite flower.  Last summer I collected Lupine seeds from the flowers growing around here. I planted them in the spring and they are just now popping up! It is a tradition that my mom and I to go buy flowers to plant in my barrels after the last snow fall, although you never know when that will be! We pick out as much color as possible. I have planted Dahlias, Cosmos, Petunias, Hollyhocks and many more.

**One piece of advice for beginners?**

Being a beginner growing food, I would advise others to not be afraid to try! It can be overwhelming learning about all you need to know and do to make a garden successful. One step at a time! It’s so exciting to see the day by day changes in your garden. Using the GeoGardenClub app has helped me to track my progress and get information from other gardeners.

**Favorite feature of GeoGardenClub?**

I love being able to look at other gardens all over the country! It's so cool to be able to share observations and learn from other gardeners!
