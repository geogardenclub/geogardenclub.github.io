# Featured Gardener: Katie

**Chapter:** Manhattan-NY

**How long have you been gardening?**

I am a rookie gardener. I started in 2022 after I moved to an apartment with outdoor space.

**What are your “must-grow” crops?**

Greens are my must grow crops! Collared greens, kale, Swiss chard, etc. I am ADDICTED to frying them up in my scrambled eggs. Also, I love that you can just pick a few leaves every day and a handful of plants can last you all summer long. Low maintenance!

**One piece of advice for beginners?**

My advice for beginners is to leave 10x more space in between your zucchinis than you think you need to. And don’t be afraid to prune even though it hurts. I am mostly talking to myself right now.

**Favorite feature of GeoGardenClub?**

I love making observations in the GGC app! Finally, a place to brag, facepalm, or send messages to future self (ie about zucchinis).
