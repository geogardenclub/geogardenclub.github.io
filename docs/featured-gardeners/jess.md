**Chapter:** Whatcom-WA


**How long have you been gardening?** 

I had my first vegetable garden in middle school! I've always loved growing food and cooking up delicious meals with stuff I've grown. I farmed for a handful of years but currently I garden with my partner Rory in our small yard and greenhouse.

**What are your “must-grow” crops?** 

Garlic and pumpkins! Garlic is just such a household staple and genuinely tastes better when you grow it yourself. And pumpkins are beautiful! So many varieties and flavors.

**One piece of advice for beginners?** 

You don't need all the tools or the perfect growing space to start - gardening can be pretty simple! Put some seeds in the ground, use GeoGardenClub to track what happened, and adjust as needed. You will learn so much watching things grow!

**Favorite feature of GeoGardenClub?** 

When I farmed, I drew maps, crafted intricate spreadsheets, and took tons of photos to capture all the data I needed to plan out plantings and it always felt disjointed. With GeoGardenClub, everything lives in one place! I have the visual representation of how long the crop will be in the bed (that I can easily edit on the fly), and if I want data on the crop, I can click on it. And I can capture observations to better visualize how the crop is growing at different times of year, in different beds, etc. It saves me so much time and headache!
