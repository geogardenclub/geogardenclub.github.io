**Chapter:** Whatcom-WA


**How long have you been gardening?** 

I’ve been gardening since the summer of 2018.

**What are your “must-grow” crops?** 

I have so many must grow crops! But maybe my favorite is tomatoes. I love how big they get. I love the varieties. And I love preserving them.

**One piece of advice for beginners?** 

I would advise beginners to think about what you want to eat. And grow that.

**Favorite feature of GeoGardenClub?** 

GeoGardenClub has a number of features I love! I really enjoy reading the observations and other people’s gardens. It informs me and gives me new ideas!
