Each With widget is responsible for displaying a "loading" icon while it waits for the required data from Firestore to arrive (or display an error if one occurs). Once the data arrives, it invokes a callback function supplied to it, passing the populated ChapterCollection, GardenCollection, and UserCollection instances.
