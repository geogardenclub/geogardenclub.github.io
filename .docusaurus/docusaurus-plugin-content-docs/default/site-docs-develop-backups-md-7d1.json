  "description": "Our current backup approach is to use Firefoo to create a JSON file containing all of the documents in the GGC Firestore database, compress this file, and upload it to the geogardenclub/backups repository.   The goal is to do this every week or two, so that in the event of catastrophe, we can restore the database to a state that doesn't lose too much work.",
